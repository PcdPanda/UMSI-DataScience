"If you truly want to curtail a rape epidemic, then you need to shut down every college and university, as most rapes occur on campuses.  Or, you know, you could just choose not to live in ignorance, fear, and paranoia."
"The problem with some people is that they're alive.
Wonder what we'd be reading now had this handsome woman defended herself with a legally owned and carried handgun fired with no collateral damage through adequate training.
A black woman killing a white pig. How would the cops have read that? 
I bet it would have lifted heads from their ""music and phones""."
"LOL...well, it's the riskiest things in life that give me my fondest memories.  And on that note...

"LOL... NOW WE HAVE REFUGEES QUESTIONING VET BENEFITS AND VA HOUSING. (READ THE COMMENTS) THIS DISGUST ME! ""REFUGEES"" ARE GETTING TO COMFORTABLE.COMFORTABLE . THESE NICE COMMENTS ARE FROM A SMALL % OF REAL AMERICANS. OUR VOTE WAS HEARD. THIS HOUSING IS REDICULOUS! AMERICANS 1ST"
The father must have known.  Gotta turn him in you not going to change his mind.  Stop sheltering these potential mass murderers.
"In other news, Ontario golf courses consume 50.5 BILLION litres of water a year. Where's the golf tax? Hypocrites."
"Gerson helped build the republican party into exactly what it is today...a fever swamp of bigotry and ignorance. Now that he's finally noticed the toxic waste dump he spent 35 years helping to create, he claims to be above it all and anybody who doesn't agree with him is a hyper-partisan. See...it's not lifelong republican Gerson's fault that modern conservatism is a rolling dumpster fire, it the fault of those ""other"" republicans over there. 

Put a sock in it, Gerson. You helped create the toxic waste dump and no amount of both siderist horsepucky will ever clean the stink off."
"Agreed. A parade of self-loathing gay people, ephebophiles, gay rights advocates plus MSW and Andrew Sullivan does not an argument make."
nope the ignorant delusional hate from canada against trump is truly sickening
They won't pass anything. They want a clean up and down vote and they will NOT get it unless they give and give a lot. That's the only thing your correct on. The GOP don't need to make a deal. After 2018 midterms the Democrats will be on their Death Bed's. After 2020 get em a body bag.
"I like Murkowski and hate the ACA, but it's getting a little old hearing republicans bashing the law without providing even a hint at a solution. This is just as useless as the democrats pretending that the ACA is working."
Please contact me if you'd be willing to talk on or off the record.

"The Truth needs to come out and when it does, the MSM and Sarah will either ignore it or spin it. 

The only thing that came out yesterday was that Leaks of classified information AND taping of Americans phone calls were leaked to the press during the Lame Duck session and Obama's staff were on the ""see"" list to review content. Also that Obama lowered the classification of the information so more people could see it.

Everything else was a giant NothingBurger. We already knew the investigation was happening."
My pet peeve it teen girls that run down people and get a slap on the wrist but lets not EVER forget that piece of human garbage.
"And who was driving the car?  Those against the protest or those in favor of the protest?

Or do you care?  As long as someone died and was injured."
Will that be enough to cover management pay increases and the cost of settling law suits from management's stupidity.
"I didn't vote for Trump and I didn't vote for Clinton either, I didn't vote for any of the candidates. I didn't feel any of them is capable to be President. It was tough s**t that Trump won. We just have to accept the fact. The way the democrats attack Trump sometime really make me laugh. Mahalo for the entertainment. Keep up the good work, you're also improving Star Advertiser's readership. If I happen to find a video, I will certainly share with you."
Happily Pennsylvania got the death penalty. We should reinstitute it here. Especially for those child killers on the Big Island. Forget chemicals or electric chair. Just hang or shoot 'em. Cheap and trouble free.
Thanks for the links.
"You don't have a clue about what AKJ's expenses are in maintaining his/her rentals. One bad tenant could wipe out a years worth of profit. I bet if you asked him/he how much he/she puts away for upkeep, Does he/she pay a property manager to handle the maintenance? Does he/she do his/her own maintenance? What about stopped up toilets, water damage, roof needs replaced... The list is endless but you'd have him/her rent the units out for what the mortgage runs?  Asinine!  I guess he/she can also get a job to support his/her family. What a ridiculous remark.  Maybe his/her rentals are the only income for the family.  You live on $700 /month."
Clinton and Obama lied to the deplorables; Trump lies on behalf of them.
I don't find it humorous at all. It's very serious.
"What a loser. Mug shot, please!"
Being costly does not mean its overly broad. As someone on the ground I can and will tell you that SB91 is a disaster. Its not fear of being imprisoned that reduced crime its keeping the criminals in jail that stops crime. You see when they are in jail they are not free to commit further crimes against citizens.  I have a 4 year degree in Criminal Justice and 17 years of service as a LEO. What is your experience pray tell?
"granted, yes, this is not a troll. i still think it presumptuous to anoint oneself defender of the faith in the combox of a catholic publication. 
the notion that conversations need to be overseen and corrected by a catechism wielding rigorist for the salvation of the souls of the readers is ridiculous."
"Hey Mags.........your long overdue for another fire department story.  These guys are getting away with murder out there with their 24 hr shift complete with nice sleeping arrangements, fine tax payer funded meals, pleanty of spare time to polish their trucks, and most importanty spare time for their CASH jobs.....please your overdue"
"The ""Five Eyes"" alliance (plus Israel) collaborate all the time...
""Three separate intelligence sources believe that former President Obama veered outside the chain of command and employed British surveillance agents to conduct surveillance on Donald Trumps team prior to the election, according to a legal analyst. ""

""Judge Andrew Napolitano revealed on Fox & Friends this morning that the sources spilled the details to him as the controversial case continues to dominate headlines.""
Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command, Napolitano said. He didnt use the NSA, he didnt use the CIA, he didnt use the FBI, and he didnt use the Department of Justice.

He used GCHQ. Napolitano explained.

... Plausible deniability indeed."
"I dont think its politics. Its a moral test. Support of Trump indicates someone who is willing to overlook the classless boor in order to push through a cruel, selfish republican agenda. It reveals a level of ignorance about how the world works. It demonstrates that the potential date is a racist, sexist, bigoted person."
"Interestingly enough, they are the weapon of choice to stop bodily harm as well. Go figure!"
The Rohingya insurgents knew that their attacks would cause strife. Why else would they have done it. Remember ...... they are muslims and muslims are pawns for the new caliphate.
"""In other words, good advice is sometimes feminine,"" Ravasi said. ""In the Vatican that is a new discovery.""

The problem is that women have always given exactly the same kind of advice as men.  Women & men do not see the world differently, as most people to not decide things with their private parts unless the question is do I want sex or not.   The  truth: The Cardinal & The Pope still want to treat sexism as though it were a culture issue & not the Human Justice & Human Dignity Issue that it is.  

Women deserve, from birth, like men, in the Catholic Church, to have the same access to all sacraments because they are equally capable, equally called by God, and equally worthy for ordination as men are, and this is true regardless of the fact that women are just as good at doing all the other things men are equally capable of doing, of which this Cardinal mentioned. 

We don't say men should not be allowed to lector because they are allowed to do other ministries.  

NO VOTE = slavery."
"Ty Cobb, like the famous baseball player? He had steel balls too!"
"Trump's not that smart, he's just acting out."
"""Ever wonder why girls were encouraged into nursing & boys to become doctors?""
And yet most GP's are women. So they dominate nursing and general medicine."
"personally I have difficulty accepting that "" originalism"" as practiced by Justice Scalia and perhaps to be practiced by Judge Gorsuch, allows for consistent rigor in the maintaining of unbiased consistency.  

What originalism seems to do is add the heavy weight of a deeply held and academically researched belief espousing the limited role of the Court, as a means to shield the judge from accusations of ideological bias upon the rendering of legal conclusions that in the absence of "" originalism"" he would find himself just as vulnerable to as those who do not abide by it's rigid interpretations, 

"" I personally do not oppose gay marriage..my interpretation of the original meaning of the constitution does""..""I personally do not support the right to carry a gun on the street, but the framer's intent, even though state militias no longer exist, prevents me from denying that right"" That sounds like the same old politics to me, not much different from the activism so often despised   ,"
How many of these deaths are due to accessing other people's prescription medications? Yes more than a few people are selling or giving their opioids to other people!!It boils down to people doing stupid and illegal acts. The folks transferring medications to others need to go to jail for a long time!!
"So now it's a global conspiracy of women; at the rate Two Tone Trump is going, on a trajectory between a greek tragedy and a shakespearean farce, it wouldn't surprise that some women start calling for a National Lysistrata Month until Trump gets exiled. Something like that  would make Saddam Husein more popular in a poll!  Dissing on women in attempt to get more female voters has got to be the most stupid campaign tactic of all time."
Still waiting for my pony to arrive. Maybe it will be under the tree on Christmas morning.
So what?
Ignorance is bliss. Sleep well!
Fetuses don't have rights.  Why would they?
"The only way to achieve the equality of outcome is to stagger law based on the individual, which implies a totalitarian society."
"Im not giving them any absolutes on the budget, and no absolutes on anything right now because I still think that you can change people's minds, Tuck said in an interview. I dont want to turn it into a gridlock. Change people's minds on what? This has been the Democrats' problem for several years now. They either have no idea what they want to do, or they're afraid to admit it in public. 

What they want here is for the majorities to offer a deal so they can pick it apart for political points. That's not not the kind of leadership their constituents want. They should have developed an alternative plan from the start, so Alaskans could draw clear conclusions about what the different caucuses stand for. Once again, this is the cowards' way out."
Insulting Canadians?  Rubbish!  Go Julie Payette!  She's spot on.  Stupidity in all its forms needs to be called out.
why?  Because politicians at all levels like cutting ribbons.  Better to fund basic research but who wants to cut a ribbon when the investigator hires a grad student?
