"Not at all.  Nothing - as in 'no THING' - can travel faster than the speed of light.  That is to say anything made of atomic or subatomic particles cannot travel faster than the speed of light because ANY particle or THING made up of particles becomes  infinitely heavy and therefore requires an infinite amount of energy to increase its velocity the closer it gets to the speed of light.

What is apparently faster than the speed of light (or 'c') in quantum entanglement is the flow of information from one entangled particle to its entangled partner.  The change in spin direction, for example, of an entangled particle is a piece of information that is transferred instantaneously from the initially affected particle to its entangled partner.

But information about a particle is not a particle itself or a 'thing' made up of particles which cannot travel as fast or faster than c.  Therefore it is not restricted to 'nothing or no THING' being unable to travel faster than the speed of light."
"Brian Mulroney was involved in politics as early as 1956 when he assisted in the campaign of former Nova Scotia Premier, Robert Stanfield.  The idea that he was a political neophyte in 1983 is fallacious."

Qubec Values started in North America with 40 First Nations by
The Treaty of the Great Peace of Montral (1701)
The French (at that time they already call themselves Canadiens), in negotiating followed their traditional policy in the Americas, where the relationship with some of the 40 Natives Nations was characterized 
by Mutual respect and Admiration 
and based on Dialogue 
and Signed in Treaty of the Great Peace of Montral (August 4th, 1701) 
is a unique diplomatic event in the history of the Americas.

"Thank you once again, APD!

Lawbreakers must be getting more stupid.  Sounds like these ne'er-do-wells had little common sense and/or awareness of reality."
I'm always curious why 'conservatives' are so mean-spirited/angry.  What IS that (in this case name-calling) about?
If only! Very few of these cop-hating clowns ever make CORA requests for those case files. They'd rather rely on conjecture and unproven alleged witness statements in the media and then move on to rioting and ambushing cops.
One of the few times I will probably ever agree with you.    The girls actions are all her own.   Yeah the guy was scum but he didnt kill her.

"Well Mr Trudeau, after years of intense negotiation with the EU by the Federal Conservatives, you, the Federal Liberals have managed to screw things up Royally.  
You should fire this supposed minister that has walked off in a huff because she wants to see her three kids tomorrow.
O Kay, go girl.  See the kids.  
And leave the rest of Canada out to dry.
Pathetic.  All of you."
"This is the dumbest editorial I have ever seen, but it helps clarify why these keep right laws are necessary. The left lane is for passing. Period.  Nobody, even if they are going 100 mph, should stay to the left.  Keep right except to pass is one of the most fundamental and universally recognized ways to maximize highway safety.  What is your problem with moving over?  Does it bruise your ego when you get passed?  Are you too lazy to be bothered with lane changes?"

"Are you reading the same article? Here, lets look at what it says.......

Next let's look at what the word defensive means....
a position or attitude of defense :
to be on the defensive about one's mistakes.

Looks like YOU'RE the defensive one Joe.
I, on the other hand, am opinionated. I walked in on my niece being molested, I helped put that sick, pathetic, looser in jail. If you're sympathetic to these sick freaks, well, you need to go get some mental help."
"Once again let me remind people that these pro Clinton people who think that Trump will ruin the world beyond repair and who take every opportunity to extend the false narratives that Trump is a racist because he wants to enforce our federal statutes and strengthen our borders, will start WWIII because he is an out of control hot head and is a bumbling idiot based upon God knows what. These are the same people who stuck the world with 8 years of Barrack Hussein Obama ...

There'll be a lot of Canadians resident in the US who would disagree with you if the US were to implement a similar ban.
"In it's zeal to do away with any and all traces of a black President who was and is infinitely more popular and certainly more revered than Trump, not to mention immeasurably more intelligent, real damage is being attempted to be done to policies the majority of the public fully supports.

The Trump regime is intent on instituting policies which are blatantly against the best interests of America and Americans, in the most undemocratic manner possible.

With the revelations of Trump's collusion with a foreign enemy of the US, the conflicts of interest, and the criminal money-laundering, any and all actions of the Trump regime should be suspended immediately until after the investigations, the court proceedings, and the impeachment process have been conducted and concluded.

Until that time, all aspects of the Trump administration should be viewed as illegitimate.

A criminal doesn't inquire about how to obtain pardons if they are innocent."

"Incorrect. AFSCME workers often write grants for money that otherwise would not benefit Lane County residents.

"The socialists have taken control of the Democrat party, I truly wish Democrats were like the democrats my father knew, now they are influenced by the likes of Saul Alinsky (socialist that both Obama and Hillary worship).

Democrats now seem to value violent groups like antifa and BLM. You may not be a socialist, but the DNC is.

"You are certainly no friend of mine. You have accused me of lying about what you had said, and run away when I proved by actual quotation that the accusation was false. We both know that, even though you praise humility, you are not humble enough to apologize.

"1/x @JustinTrudeau lives up to his word: Canada doesnt cave on TPP despite enormous pressure to agree to the deal and invariable criticism for agt at any price. Key sticking points said to be auto, agriculture, culture and IP. Whats behind these issues?

Two additional thoughts on TPP. First, Canada was late to TPP talks. In order to enter, Conservatives agreed that Canada would have no veto authority. In other words, it could never be sole opponent on a chapter. Left negotiators in a very weak position.

With the U.S. out and the chance to rethink some of the TPP provisions, that condition was gone. Far stronger position than the Conservative approach, which left Canada in a potential take-it-or-leave-it dilemma on key issues (obviously they took the deeply flawed deal)."

There really isn't much sense in consolidating services into UAF.  UAA is the larger school with more students it makes much more sense to have in it in Anchorage where the majority of the population of the state resides.  As a student of both UAF and UAA I would say it should be in Anchorage.  For example for recruiting and retention of personal from Outside what is going to be your pitch?  Come to scenic sleepy Fairbanks where you can enjoy -50 degrees routinely and have nothing to do during the winter.  Similar to how they have trouble retaining teachers for remote Alaska.  This is just another power grab by UAF to justify their existence.

You are correct that the average Democrat would be confuse a one sheet flyer with a thick booklet. They are such fools.
"Well borrowing someone's car isn't really comparible to, say, renting a place and trying to make a home of it. But I get your basic point. But that only means that everything in society is up for the highest bidder and no one really has a right to claim anything as their own. Perhaps people are wrong for even using the word 'home', unless they actually own it. But even then it can be snatched right out from under you, if you don't own the land. 

I guess nobody has rights at all unless they're a wealthy land owner. Maybe you're fine living in that kind of world, but I'm not."

"""Climate refugees"" is a valid way to describe the situation of the polar bear in a way that an average reader can understand. The term also includes human beings, such as those that fled the dust bowl of Oklahoma and the Great Plains for California, and villagers here in our state that are being forced from their homes by coastal erosion. There will be more and more climate refugees in the future as cities like Miami are submerged by rising seas. Denial of the facts is not going to make this problem go away."
"You realize those are non-mainstream polls that don't align wit many others that show opposite results right?  And they aren't even the latest - there are more polls out today.

"Trudeau long ago said if you were personally against abortion, even if you agreed to vote on party lines on the matter, you still couldn't be a Liberal.  Like the Taleban, ISIS and liberal progressives, he forbids you to have personal views other than the approved ones to be associated with him.  Harper said you can have your personal views but you must vote on party lines.  Today's Canadians and their media prefer a dictator as long as he's got nice hair and is a cool dude."

I have worked in Liquor Stores for well over 17 years and have seen this come up on the ballot before. Since it was on the ballot the last time Washington has since become private....And if the residents of Oregon think this is going to be a good thing for Oregon they need to go live in Washington and Purchase their Liquor and Beer.... You will be blown away how much you are paying in Taxes..The State of Oregon is going to get their money one way or another.. So before you vote yes read up on it and know what you are saying yes to.....Or we will end up like Washington with terrible selections and nothing close to what you ar looking for but still having to pay a arm and a leg for it....Or Like Washington residents do drive to another state to get what you want at a cheaper price.

Stinky...
What utter rubbish. Without addressing what makes these insane killing sprees possible - absurdly lax gun laws - Trump's words are simply hollow evasions of the truth. These incidents have happened so many times now that there seems to be some kind of script followed - as Schribman seems to understand - that does everything possible to avoid targeting the real evil here - a pathological and totally paranoid devotion to guns on the part of a significant minority of Americans.
Trump is not allowing Russia to do anything.  The allegations of influence are garbage.
"That's a ridiculous thing to say.  ""Well, we abuse, slaughter, execute millions of pets a year, so setting out torture devices that kill thousands of animals in a horrific manner is ok, comparatively speaking.""'  Point taken.

Oh but I do get it  Eric ( that Republican votes in CA and OR would count, likewise Democratic votes in TX, etc, etc. ). So, what was your point?

We have a republic(in theory anyway) with or without the EC, its only in your mind that we dont. The EC is what it is, you call it theft because your preferred candidate lost and if she hadnt, this discussion wouldnt exist.

"Exactly. Obama poured oil over troubled waters, calming people in the wake of what appeared to many to be a huge injustice - the stalking of an unarmed teen who was killed while attempting to save his own life from that armed stalker.

There's quite a contrast between the two presidents, Obama speaking to soothe tempers over a perceived injustice, Trump doubling down on his condemnation of those protesting violence against black citizens, calling them ""sons of b****es. Obama was recognized as a peacemaker, Trump earned the contempt of all decent people.

Obama didn't use the fact of black-on-black crime to justify the verdict, which was not that Trayvon was guilty - he wasn't on trial, he was dead, shot by a creepy self-appointed wanna-be cop; Obama pointed out that the jury found reasonable doubt that the armed creep committed intentional murder. It is you, motley, who is using a statement out of context to justify the killing of a black teen who was doing nothing illegal."

You are so quick to characterize all Christians by this man's actions, actually only threats, and draw some kind of moral equivalence to Muslim extremists around the world who are murdering in the most brutal ways imaginable.

I can't speak for all parents.  I can only speak for myself as a parent. The education my kids receive in public school is pretty stellar. 

There are benefits of different types of classes, immersion programs, optional classes and/or the trips out of state such as the one to Hawaii my orchestra student just experienced.  Therefore from my perspective I'd say that public school offers children, especially kids whose parents have little resources, the ability to propel further in life."

This report card would rank and  evaluate everything from Outputs: education, clean water,  maternal and child health, housing, mental health and employment to 

Processes: fiscal management, corruption, quality of leadership, institutional integrity, transparency, and so on.

Tie funding to performance indicators. Make it public so leaders are held accountable and most of all ensure that the analysis and the results are OWNED by the people.

The truth is there are a number of well run, prosperous and corrupt free reserves and these need public attention  as much as the bad ones. Learn from them. 

A public Governance Audit would not only recognize excellence  it would also name and shame those leaders who are letting down their own people.

Transparency and Accountability. It is what all governments should strive for.

The biggest unknown is the tax structure. Alaska's Constitution does not allow the Legislature to set a tax rate more than 2 years in advance and oil companies and big foreign customers do not trust Alaska to make a deal on taxes and then leave it alone. Greedy Legislators prompted by greedy voters will crank up taxes every session and one only has to look at the oil industry for proof.

Contrary to the point Mr. Trump was trying to make, there is little, if any, evidence that the Taliban had any foreknowledge of the 9-11 attacks."
"Unfortunately, Fr. Pavone's tactics are gross as well as delusional.  Pro-life means respecting humans born with disabilities, physical as well as mental, about being against total warfare [which could kill millions at a time], and is against slavery.  Fr. Pavone is not against slavery.  He believes he has the right to demand, in the name of God, that women must give birth if they are impregnated---no matter under what condition that pregnancy occurs.  He doesn't realize that this is an act of slavery.



If an individual does not have control over their bodies, their very lives for almost a year [not due to incarceration in prison for a crime], this is church-enforced slavery.  Abortion and how to perform it, was included in the Midrash tradition of Judaism, even in the 1st Century in Palestine.  Jesus knew about it, and did not condemn it."
"Trump is test-driving his power to pardon. True: Trump and Arpaio are kindred spirits: racist to the core, contemptuous of the law, the Constitution and the values of the United States. But Trump doesn't care about anyone or anything other than Donald Trump; Arpaio is nothing to Trump.
Trump is not only a racist but a career criminal whose criminal life is teetering on the edge of the congressional investigations and the Mueller investigation. The power to pardon is one of the arrows in Trump's quiver as he contemplates a strategy to pardon and fire his way through this crisis. He is likely to fire Mueller and to pardon anyone who can hurt him -- including himself.
The fact that POTUS is crazy is not grounds to impeach, and the process for removing him because he's crazy is beyond cumbersome. He must be impeached for his crimes, which is itself a tough process. But the Congress must get on with it; I think they are already laying the groundwork. It would be malfeasance if they aren't."
"Nothing much more cheaper then phony empathy coming from Clintonite surrogates. Don't believe me ask the poor Haitian people. Talk about a criminal type of Ponzi scheme.

""By all accounts, the money and what it was meant to do never really reached the Haitian people. While the Clinton Foundation only puts 10% of its donations towards charity, the IHRC was a real racket for Clinton pals, 1% went towards Haitian groups and agencies on the ground. All that is transparent is that the money didnt go to Haiti, beyond that the trail goes cold. The money for earthquake relief was funneled massively to friends of the Clintons, who so happen to be donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation and Hillarys 2016 presidential campaign.""

"Can you imagine the special prosecutors, hearings, commissions, outrage, bloviating gas bags if Obama, Biden, and especially Hillary had done even one of the outrageous things Trump has done either as a candidate or President?   I can.....Fox TV would have to bring back Ailes, O'Reilly, and a slew of additional self righteous demagogues to blast, shout, and spew forth their venom.

"TDW,

Conventional cars are being challenged. As I mentioned elsewhere, sales of conventional cars decreased by 7% last month while sales of EVs went up by 19%. The increase in EV sales is part of a long term trend. There is no reason why that trend should change. Most Canadians drive about 40 km a day. Most Canadians could easily charge an EV at home with a low power outlet. The price of EVs and batteries will continue to drop. EV sales will keep increasing."

"I replied to all the nonsense in your Slate post.  I am not real crazy about Josh Marquis, overall, but I agree with his position quoted in Slate.  Here is a re-print of my response in case you missed it.

""I have to agree with most of the decisions and positions of those prosecutors cited in the article.
The US Supreme Court has upheld our Jury system numerous times and our death penalty standards as well.
The number of convicted black people is pretty much equal to the number of black people committing the crimes. And most of those crimes are against other black people, from drive-bys where six year old girls are killed, multiple murders and assaults outside strip joints and gang fights over drugs and prostitution. to just cover this year's Portland crime scene."""

Yes that includes delivery, debt retirement, etc. Bills in some US jurisdiction are 50-80% higher for the same amount of kwh. Not including water, maybe you are looking at your water charge and getting confused. I don't know. Lets just agree on where we stand so that we can figure out a reasonable solution going forward.

Mr Cobell I will ask you are you going to sit their and deny that SB 21 lets CP deduct most is not all expenses on many of their fields? At long last are we not supposed to be in a free market, are we in the business of corporare welfare?

 ...by bringing a single detail about Muslim women into the headline, then moving onward to Ramadan, and morphing the story into a racial intolerance theme, MSM is certainly contriving more political froth while pandering to it's anti-Trump target audience of simple-minded liberals, plus whatever racist groups they can aggitate on the flip-side.  Shame on the Oregonian, the Associated Press, and the Denver Post.  I seriously doubt this event has anything to do with Ramadan.

"I think the transgender issues could be greatly simplified by simply testing for fecundity:

If one's body produces sperm or xy....= assign male gender
If one's body produces egg or xx = assign female gender

This rules out all of the very rare hermaphrodites, since no single hermaphodite produces functioning egg AND sperm..or xx AND xy.

So that will narrow down the pool of issues considerable.  The goal is to simplify the pool by operational criteria, not feelings. 

Then tell the ""I produce x but feel like y"" people that they are what they produce, and that's how our society is going to work.  Go get an operation on your own dime that allows you to produce the other..and when we verify it, we'll change your legal designation.""

The Islamophobia motion was a dumb idea.  I consider myself centre-left and completely disagree with it, since hatred is hatred no matter who is the victim.  If we have a motion to protect Muslims, do we need several dozen more to protect other minorities?  And just what will it achieve, anyhow?  All it has done is polarize the issue, which, presumably, is the exact opposite of its intention.

If the Liberals get smart enough to continue implementation of socially progressive policy without ramming multiculturalism into the faces of those that really don't want it their success in 19 is assured.

In fact, she has been more honest.  You people have no clue what you are saying.  Sanders has created innuendo knowingly that you wont fact check what he is saying because this ""honesty"" issue is a something the right has cultivated over 25 years.  Sanders likes to use things like the Iraq War, yet he voted for regime change in Iraq a few years prior  - TWICE.  And this is what led to the invasion.  And yet you never listen to why she voted for it the first place.  I say: grow up or wake up.  Which ever comes first."

BEE was never about equability nor is it about equal opportunity. It is about being in power and staying in power based on the color of ones skin and political affiliation. I have worked within parastatals and now  government and have seen firsthand the consequences. Forced demographic representation. What a flawed unnatural racist concept. Everything the powers that be designed has been designed to stay in power and to push out minority groups. Luckily BEE employs based on skin color and political affiliation with skills and know how carrying very little weight. As a side effect this creates a lot of opportunities for people who know what they are doing. As a result BEE costs a lot more than the market would naturally allow and as a result life gets a lot more expensive. The money needs to come from somewhere and the actual work still needs to get done right? In the end it is the poor that will suffer even more. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot just to get rid of whites.

"As a Native I see the parallels between the church sanctioned policies of colonialism foisted on the Natives here, starting with syphilis infected Christopher Columbus, famed slaver and mass murderer who died with a gaping hole where his nose used to be, and the Imperial Roman Empire, who invaded and occupied other countries, slaughtering the Natives and enslaving the survivors, so the parasites and leeches could make their civilized blood money profits off the backs of the Natives. 100 million plus slaughtered Natives here, and countless terrorized and murdered people of color who were brought here to work or die, for a privileged few.
The same ilk of people from Imperial Rome's heyday, ramrods our government, no one can change the course, to try will bring assassinations, look to JFK when he was going to pull America out of Vietnam.
Colonialism is an ugly word, like Pioneers, because of the policies of theft and murder that comes on the backs of Natives and other people of color."

"It was a bizarre scene out of some Junior High after-school group who had been punished and forced to go to detention. Part of their punishment was to praise their principal, clearly.

Trump spoke for a few minutes about all of his imagined accomplishments, boasting about how well President Obama's economy is performing, (taking credit for it), and even citing great unemployment numbers that he repeatedly called fake during the presidential election.

Faith that if government not only repealed Obamacare but went even further and repealed ALL government interference in the industry (things like selling across state lines; allowing businesses to form a 'medishare' pool/program; removing the mandatory options you must carry but don't want or need) then we would unleash the creative potential of business and individuals making their own decisions."

We are Canadians and simply above the inanities of the lesser peoples. It is so stupid to think these savages might have the potential to become what we are or that they have the ability if only given our intervention. Better to simply feel bad, even somewhat concerned about life's inequities, to voice our disapproval of the tyrants and offer our heartfelt sympathies for their victims - but nothing else other than some token charity to show we're a generous, feeling lot."

I understand that Republican voters don't want to support Hillary, but I can't understand how you can be so blind and willfully ignorant to defend your own party's candidate in the face of behavior that is utterly reprehensible by any 'objective', non-partisan standard. 

Bringing up all the supposedly bad things the Clintons have done over the years in defense of Trump's outrageous comments and behavior only makes you look like a hypocrite. Two wrongs simply don't make a right. Our senators finally seem to have understood that, sometimes it's more important to put your country before your own party. This election is long past differences about political or economic theories. It's about the fundamental values and moral principles that we stand for as a nation. Nobody asks Republicans to vote for Hillary, but at least have the courage and decency to not support someone as disgusting and unethical as Trump"

"I was expecting something more restrictive from the committee, so I'm pleasantly surprised that they delivered a more moderate set of recommendations. For example, I'm glad that they didn't follow the CMA's recommendation to set the minimum age at 25, which would've forced all young adults outside the legal market. However, the plain packaging requirement is unwise, and works against their goal to allow ""craft"" products, as plain packaging makes it difficult for new products to gain market share by outlawing branding and advertising.

And as always, the door has been left open for provinces to muck this up, and there's always the possibility the government could ignore the committee's report and implement something dumber."
Best comment here.
"Again, there is a significant difference between the straw-man argument that you're outlining, and what happened here.

In your straw-man argument, it's all about the way that the cake is decorated.  You state that ""racist message"" on the cake.  The baker would be well within their rights to deny that cake, as long as they don't make that cake for anybody.

Now, in the case of the gay wedding cake, the has nothing to do with how the cake was decorated.  The cake decoration was not brought up at all, and the refusal to make the cake was done before any decoration had been discussed.  He could have made the exact cake for a straight couple a week ago, and he still would have denied the gay couple that exact same cake."

"We have long needed an income tax for residents and non-residents alike. How (ir)responsible we've been with government paid for by Big Oil*. Can you remember The Corrupt Bastards Club? Once in the system, it would be fairly easy to keep a line on who is in-state and who is non-resident, and the PFD can be tracked more better. PLUS, it will reduce the number of folks coming here looking for freebies, and maybe discourage some of the wasters already up here to soak up our PFDs hunt cheaply on state licenses, and maybe score a payoff from the Slope.

*I am a FAN of Big Oil. They provide jobs, they're good for the overall U.S. energy trade, I've met a lot of good people working for them, and they contribute big taxes. But they have their own interests, and I prefer them out of the State government. Paying your own way (on government, as on other needs) is the highest of good conservative principles.

"This is THE test of Trump's ability as Commander In Chief, caretaker and leader of people of USA, stateman, and World Leader (or, ""leader"" of World's leading countrty).  There is an uninformed madman with his finger on the button of who knows what, sqaure in the middle of a region where US interests economically, geopolitically, and even socially are significant.  So, Trump is showing his biceps and saying ""go ahead, I dare you.""  If he's successful in this episode, what does it accomplish?  North Korea disarmament?  If he is not successful, what catastrophes await?  Very scary that 4 obviously more prudent and able Presidents before refused to engage in a military stare down like this with the North.  Scary to think that the incomplete, ruderless, and buffoonish Trump admin is the support team for this process.  Very scary."
"Trump took over his dad's business after he gave it to all of his kids in equal shares.  Trump made it grow.  His dad didn't die until many years after that.  Most of his business ventures were not failures; you read about the ones that were.  

After the Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the passive loss and depreciation rules in investment properties, but grandfathered the existing rules for current investments, it had an unintended consequence.  Banks and S&Ls had to meet strict loan-to-value limits on their real estate loan portfolios, based on appraised values.  Well, appraisals are based on ""resale"" values, and the changes in the rules would apply to the new buyer, and since after-tax incomes dropped by around 50%, so did the appraised value.  Banks and S&Ls had to call in loans, the borrowers couldn't pay them, and had to dump the properties on the market.  That was the ""S&L Crisis"" that caused Trump to lose $960 million, and while many others went bankrupt, he didn't and survived."

Investment opportunities.  See?

Do you really think a little fat leader in North Korea would commit suicide by attacking the USA?  No one is that stupid.  We are being played and have always been played.  This is why Trump stepped in, to try and take our country back.  I have very close contacts within the Trump family.  Trump knows the extent of the evil we face and he plans to take them all down.  If you have any love for America you will pray every day for Trump to succeed.  This is why these demons are frothing at the mouth when they speak about Trump.

If the airline needed to get their employees to another destination, they should have booked them on another flight. Very stupid decision making on the part of the airline higher ups."

North Korea threatens to destroy South Korea, Japan, and the USA.  It presently only possesses the capability of destroying South Korea.  It makes the threats against Japan and the USA, even as it develops and tests missiles and nuclear warheads. 
Iran has made similar threats against Saudi Arabia and the USA.  Iran and North Korea have collaborated, for years, on their missile and nuclear development.  The Obama solution for the collaboration was to pretend it doesn't exist.  The tests of nuclear warheads in North Korea have been Iranian, as well as North Korean.

Plus, it's a forgone conclusion tRump will be the biggest loser since 2012. Should be interesting though, to see how he reacts after November 8. Probably like all of his bankruptcies and failed marriages, he's going to blame his loss on others and not himself.

I'm looking forward to reading all about the Donald-Millennial divorcing him and the new latest model, mail order bride he'll be shopping for. tRump is like Mr. Selfridge.

""DU oxides, with their dangerously long half-lives...""

An interesting article, but a bit overwrought.  Depleted uranium is a hazardous substance but to say that it remains a danger for all eternity without caveat is simply fear mongering. Even the most dangerous and long lived radioactive isotopes decay over time, hence the term ""half-life""

So what if Hitler never used poison gas in warfare-- he used poison gas to kill thousands of Jews in an effort to eliminate the Jewish people so there is really no comparison. Only an idiot would think it makes sense to compare Assad to Hitler on their use of poison gas.

"The WSJ is reporting that the DPRK missile tested today could have hit Denver if the trajectory had been flatter.

The DPEB/staff still labors under the illusion that Kim is not a real threat;  this is gross journalistic malpractice.

The DPRK has made its intentions very clear:  its goal is to have the capability to ""mercilessly annihilate"" the US and its allies.  Already, Kim has this capability with biological weapons, cyber-warfare, smuggled nukes, nukes launched from subs, freighters and satellites.  A thermonuclear warhead on an ICBM will soon be realized as well.

Russia, China, and other nuclear powers are run by somewhat rational leaders.  Kim is nothing more or less than a lunatic, psychopathic murderer who threatens the West's existence.

The West can either continue its failed policy of appeasement to the Kim dynasty or it can decapitate Kim.

If the West wants to survive it must kill Kim and his inner circle.

The DP and its readers need to wake up to this fact or perish."

"All of which are subjective claims which depend entirely on what you already believe - not facts.

They are it's most important defense against abuse. 
As for being elected. Scared voters are stupid voters. She made them fear Russia.

The true test of a leader is how the weakest and most vulnerable people did under them. Go ask gay people what Thatcher did to them. There is a reason they held celebratory parties when she died. She caused them endless grief and misery. 

Conservatives always seem to end up marginalising somebody, denying somebody rights they enjoy, oppressing somebody. When liberals demand equal rights for them you call it 'political correctness'.

"It is happening again! A guy like Trump comes along, and the majority fall for him as a serious human with more to do than abuse the office he runs for--they believe. Promises made, promises soon broken. It is the media's fault. They only print part of his comments during the election process and none of the rest of what he says, but blame followers as if they don't read well. The game is to screw the voters anyway which way they can. Trump knows we are serious about immigration. These people commit serious crime and mostly not caught due to they are not policed like average citizens. There aren't enough officers to do that. Laws in Oregon prevent too many non whites other ethnicity arrested. They do steal, torture  and eat people's pets--cats and dogs. These people, and I am speaking  of all illegals here-- are not trying as hard as we are led to believe. Crime for fun! Worked with illegals for 17 years. Speaking the truth here--they love to brag. Arrogant. Force them out!"

With an income tax, Alaska would have access to an income stream from out-of-state workers who fly up here, earn a paycheck, and leave while buying hardly anythingwe'd lose out entirely on revenues from them if a sales tax-only scheme were implemented.

We (generally locally, not the state) already get an income stream from tourists in the form of things such as bed taxes. Much better to gain income from a new source (e.g.,slope workers), I'd say."

It is very lightweight and portable with an excellent safety switch to prevent accidental discharge if you take a spill on your mountain bike or while running your race. With a conversion kit it weighs in at 8.5 pounds and slightly longer than a machine pistol. Fits any backpack with ease, or sling over shoulder for those surprise bear attacks!

I say when bears get bearish, shoot first and apologize and pay any fines later! But shoot with something that puts em down the first time, EVERY TIME! Wounding wild animals just makes them more dangerous. This way is more humane and economical than killing innocent bears, and hospital bills. Also avoids funerals.  Protect yourself people!

Shameful that a supposedly modern country can't manage an institution in a modern, efficient way. Similar things no doubt happen in other institutions.

Governments clearly need to institute more efficient oversight, but budget constraints surely have something to do with it. When political factors mean governments can't be seen to invest more in prisons, for example. Well investing more may mean a better chance they will be managed more humanely, that's a GOOD thing."

Which is going to roll back some of the business choking  EPA regulations.  These are the things that will effect Alaska's future. Please make your vote count. Today I think I heard the Electoral College close enough that the Alaska votes could make a difference. God Bless America!!!

"Leave it to PETA and the Animal Rights wackos to deprive the rest of us of an amazing delicacy. Face it, wackos: the ducks and geese are cultivated food animals. They are the property of farmers, just the same as the chickens we raise for eggs and for their meat. I have seen farmed ducks and geese that are ""force fed"" to enlarge their livers to create the best foie gras. They aren't resistant to the process, and they don't seem to be in discomfort. Rather, they seem to enjoy the feasting.  Okay, PETA and Animal Rightists, if YOU don't want to eat foie gras or meat, or wear leather shoes, then don't. But keep your noses out of the preferences of the rest of us!"

"This is a common theme of the cry-baby Left here in Canada especially Toronto, to wit: that America is racist society. If this is so, then why did Americans elect Barry Obama? And as I've posted before, America invented the following: the airplane, the assembly line, nuclear power, the digital computer, polio vaccine, MRI, the transistor, the integrated circuit. And, what is Canada's contribution to high tech? The roller brush that is used in house painting. And, that is all she wrote. 

Dude, I see you have a lot of time to waste on Canadian lefty news websites. I suggest you expand your Web surfing to check out more balanced news on the Brit websites."

"Well said. But we must ask ourselves why has so much vehemence developed, and continues to increase, against public employees? It now colors every debate about taxes and spending in Oregon, in a very unhealthy way: Oregonian against Oregonian.  I know I'll be accused of blaming the victim, but the unions' absolute intransigence and litigiousness on the issue of pensions has played a role. If they offered even one tiny concession to help balance this budget, it would go a long way toward beginning a healing process."
So if it was an inside job what was the reasoning behind it?
"My family was homeless when I was a child in Sacramento, Humboldt County, Utah and Colorado. I was homeless on my own as a teenager in Seattle, the Olympics, Vancouver Island, Eugene and finally Portland when I was 18 during the era of the back and forth legislation of the sit-lie law.

I had the fortune of meeting so many good people in Portland who encouraged me to see where not riding trains would take me. Regardless of the short term emergency answers that American cities come up with, mental health resources cannot be overlooked because homelessness and the circumstances which lead to homelessness are traumatizing.

For me, the work it took to navigate the changes of an improved socioeconomic status were in many ways more challenging than adapting to the dangers and plights of poverty. Perhaps it is just my experience, or perhaps it can be attributed to the adaptable plasticity of children."
"Wow powerful words.  Francis lives by saying he has no tolerance for child abuse, while actually doing nothing to stop it within the church.

"The prices are sustainable it's the volume of new units built that isn't sustainable.  There are lots of people that are willing to pay the prices to in luxury units downtown, but there isn't an unlimited supply of these renters.

The good news is that these luxury building won't sit empty, just like the market suggests they will lower prices to fill them up.  This will trickle down and cause prices across the board to decrease."
Seems like a very dumb think tank. Trump is simply putting up a high enough tariff that will force auto makers to manufacture in the US. Whether cars cost more or not is another matter. The jobs will be in the US making Trump's goal realized.

"BC now has the HIGHEST rate of small business ownership in Canada.  It was well over 19% of citizens by 2015.  The province is in an economic boom because of the success of mom n pop businesses in BC helped by the low taxes.  This is in spite of the global decline of resource industries like forestry.  It is small businesses that hire all those extra people which has delivered the LOWEST unemployment rate in Canada, and historic low for BC.  The NDP plan of raising small business taxes WILL kill off BC's edge in small business and result of hundreds of thousands thrust into unemployement - like happened in the NDP 90s"

Finally, the Republican party's backwardness is coming home to roost and what do we see?

"I survived many forms of abuse from my parents and in the process of trying to heal I found that if I made it a mathematical equation in which I added up the good things and subtracted the bad things I was left with nothing.  And so I learned to hold on to the good independently from things that were (definitely) evil.  Recognizing that they were themselves abused was different than recognizing they chose to be perpetrators.  And so on.
Here I recognize that not all the bishops were equally at fault--that it was not just the Church but ALL OF SOCIETY that was covering up the sexual abuse of children--that a human evil became a church tradition--and the bishops became trapped in that tradition. And that, no matter how deep our hurt, anger and impatience, we must give the bishops space and time and encouragement to fully repent and change.  Pope Francis has called the bishops to take another step forward.  I'm sure AB Gregory recognizes the relationship between racism and sexual abuse."

"Of course we want the best medical care. But we need to recognize that 'universal health care' in Canada is a rationed system.  The procedure is 'widely available' in the US, to those with good health insurance, we should add.

The US spends 50% more than Canada (per capita) on health care.  I think the bureacrat got it right.  We dont have unlimited resources, said Irfan Dhalla, vice-president of evidence development and standards at Health Quality Ontario, the agency that oversees the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee, known as OHTAC. How do we spend the resources we do have to maximally benefit the people of Ontario?

If we spend more on each procedure, that is going to take away from some other form of health care. Maybe people wait 3 months longer for a knee replacement, or some other procedure is de-listed.

That's the nature of rationed health care, which is a better description for our health care system than ""universal health care""."
"Did you listen to that? If you did you know it has nothing to do with whether Trump or anyone who is not the Attorney General of the United States asked him to stop an investigation.

"Yes, but the much harder question to deal with is whether Trump's comment has elements of truth.  Knee jerk acceptance of status quo prevents improvement.  I would say that Gorsuch's criticism of the American President falls in the same category as Trump's criticism of the courts.  The difference for liberals is that the courts are usually good to them while they hate Trump's guts."

"Ironically, Hillary did a repeat of her loss with Obama.  She just assumed it was her turn, her machine and elite donors would do the work for her.  When you think about it, Obama did the same thing that Trump did, he campaigned to win even with the same machine and donors that Hillary had.  Soros jumped to Obama and dumped Hillary, however, he put millions upon millions for her in this run to include paying the  disruptive thugs at the Trump rallies.  Hillary had zero enthusiasm at her small rallies  with the exception of when she had her entertainer friends do her work for her.  She did not connect with the people as Trump and Bernie did, do press or answer questions.  The only networks she appeared on were the ones who were in her pocket, so again, no hard questions.  She also ran on being a female vs issues as her experience in her 30 yrs. of service proved  zero accomplishments.  What Bernie and Trump did was connect and awaken the silent minority, who in turn, became the majority"

"The author forgot to mention a few things. The first thing this (so-called) administration did was remove the LGBT section from the White House website. A little foreboding, no? And the legal brief that they supplied that said that the Civil Rights Act doesnt apply to LGBT Americans, that was for a case that they werent even a party to. So the Trump administration went out of their way to make it clear to all Americans that they dont support gay rights. As for transgender Americans serving in the military, Trump lied when he explained why he wants this ban: having transgender people serve is too expensive, and we need to be ready to win. We now know that is a bald-faced lie. The military spends 10-times as much money on erectile dysfunction drugs; and there are currently (approx) 15,000 trans military people currently serving... without issue. So both of Trumps excuses dont hold water. This is simply Trump pandering to his religious base. Pathetic."

"The problem posters such as yourself face is that the average Canadian over the age of 45 has direct experience with the health care system, either personally or through the experience of our dear parents.  We take our direct experience and compare it to statements such as yours and they simply do not line up - as demonstrated by openwater above.   

It is true, however, that results vary from Province to Province.  Recent Ipsos polling shows Ontario as the most improved healthcare system over past five years for ease of access and patient experience, followed by the Prairies (Manitoba/Saskatchewan) not far behind, with Alberta and Quebec tied in the middle, Atlantic Canada much further back and British Columbia well back at the bottom.  Yet. BC is getting good marks from openwater.

Your vote won't count. So sad you don't get that.
"""Why?"" you ask. Well, I don't know if it's possible or even realistic but the idea of currying favour with Chinese commercial interests is to gain access to the huge Chinese market for Canadian products which means more jobs for Canadians. There are plenty of Canadian businesses that would love to have the 1.4 billion residents of that country as potential customers. Our market is tiny compared to that."
"I didn't read your article - I couldn't get past the title, ""I'm an analog girl in a digital world"".  I couldn't read an article by an obviously older female profssional who calls herself a ""girl"".  Really, Margaret!

One of the first things feminists had to do was continually challenge sexist language.  So let me give you a challenge this year: embrace your inner feminist. (She must be in there somewhere. If she's not, do let us know and I'll be sure to skip your writings in future).  

Or perhaps you were practising writing some ""literary crap"" we're going to be force fed here for the next four years? Remember the old phrase, ""If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem""? 

Hey, it's 2017!  I don't give a damn what's happening in Canada's basement (the U.S.). Let's keep calling ourselves and other women, ""girls"", and we will again be treated like girls were in the fifties, sixties and seventies. A madman in the basement is determined to see that happen."
Yes it is.  Guns are too easily available so that nut cases can go around shooting people.  We have a terrorist who was killed in Washington DC yet he was not referred to as a terrorist.  Why?  If he was dark skinned or a Muslim would this story been reported differently?  Wonder what his religious affiliation was?

Always, always, always the same old refrain based on what is only your perceived notion of what's right.

Alberta deserves a reasonable and rational alternative to vote for their legislature. I'm heartened to see so many others agree here, and within the Alberta Conservative Party. At a time when so many other jurisdictions are going reactionary right, Alberta shows common-sense in tacking to the inclusive centre. We need to see and hear more of that from Alberta, Alberta has produced some fine politicians nationally. We need more."

"seriously, you have no clue what or whether Trump reads.  Regarding the Iraq war, those of us whose opinion does not matter, i.e. are not involved in any decision process don't have to formulate an opinion.  I suspect that Trump, like me, was concerned, but knew that the politicians driven by their special interests would make decisions entirely without regard to individual citizen input and therefore stood back without strong engagement in the matter.  I suspect that Trump basically took a distant view.  Clinton on the other hand was a politician at the time.  It was her job to formulate and vote in the best interests of the country.  She, like many other politicians, failed us."

"Kag, the ""cesspools of gossip and backstabbing"" may be a bit hard for catholic communities to acknowledge but you do have a point. However, such behaviour was also common in early Christian communities. We are human beings. But wasn't that the point of the incarnation?

You are correct though, JP II and Benny wrecked that spiritual progress for many."

"Thank you Wallonia - I hope you are reading comments.

Do not allow the global bullying, and that is what it is and I am ashamed that Canada is taking part in it, deter you from protecting your farmers and producers and their local market. 

Free trade is not fair trade (it is not even free trade, but handing business all the keys to government) and typically only works for the global elite. In fact, the Canadian Politician who was there and made some comments has written about this very topic and identified that it only stops when regions such as Wallonia stop it.

Some argue that fair trade would ensure that there is one currency, that it cannot be manipulated, and that no cost would be subsidized (i.e. such as some countries subsidizing the energy costs to ship their subsidized cheaply made goods around the world) and would therefore mean that local goods are the least costly."

"As H.L Mencken said ""There is always a well-known solution to every human problem  neat, plausible, and wrong."" Trump claimed that he could deliver healthcare better and cheaper than Obama could. Now he says ""Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated."" The leaders of Brexit promised that the UK could have its cake and eat it too, and English voters believed it. Now they are shocked that the EU isn't willing to give them access to European markets without paying their share and without following rules.  Of course you can offer clear, appealing alternatives - you just have to be ignorant or willing to lie."

"Illegal households gross cost (not net, which would include what they put back into the system through work, purchase, tax, etc.) per year is about $54 billion USD (net would be less).  The unnecessary wars in the middle east cost so far about $6 trillion USD from 2001 to 2016.  That's about $400 billion per year.

It's comical to me how those so bent on stopping a guy with a leaf blower taking some garbage job from an uneducated American is the financial threat to this nation, when we spend 8 times per year on unnecessary wars that serve only to increase our enemy count across the planet.  One would think a person would focus on the big problems and not the little ones."

Comparing yourself to the public -sector is nonsense - its not those employees' fault that they had enough skills to get hired to reap those benefits.

"Who are these ""human rights"" warriors trying to protect?  Good folks, probably.  But they have chosen to step around those who are waiting to legally enter our county.  That brands them as criminals, no question. And their actions are a slap in the face of law abiding immigrants, many of whom become legal citizens. Isn't following our immigration laws the root of our success in being the ""melding pot?""  That pot is made up of those who respect our laws and assimilate, contribute their talents to the good of our nation, educate themselves and their children to become productive members of society.  And, yes, walk free among and with the rest of us. They are proud and should be.

"Aloha Nathan, 

Be great to see an investigative article: ""The History of Longlining in Hawaii!""  The current President of PACIFIC OCEAN PRODUCERS and VESSEL MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATES INC introduced modern longline equipment to Hawaii in the mid 80's and the longline industry exploded from 15 boats to over 150  by 1993.  Their capacity is now double what their annual quota for Bigeye tuna can bear so they buy Bigeye quota from thousands of miles away. 

2/3rd of the boats are owned by naturalized foreigners; where did the boats come from?  It's a crime how longline owners took advantage of the wage exemption by late Senator Daniel Inouye and punishment is warranted.  I support evicting the worst offenders to reduce the over-capacity of the longline fleet.  I also support restrictions on exports of fish landed in Hawaii considering we depend on nearly 90% of our food being imported draining local capital to the tune of $3 billion annually.  Anyone know how much fish is exported from Hawaii."

Yet, the media fawn all over the president as though he had achieved an enormous victory for world righteousness.""  What are you thinking?  Would it be OK and laudable for Trump to bomb if lots of people got hurt?  The mission was to destroy facilities which terrorists need for their evil deeds, not kill people who may be innocents.  Regarding treason, do you mean investigations like those of the Obama administration led to treason charges? Have you not heard that since Trump's meeting with the Chinese president and because of their frustrations with North Korea's continual missile threats, 150,000 Chinese troops may have been deployed along the North Korea border with others preparing to move?  As for currency manipulation, China's GDP is fake (I have no room here for details), but you could contact George Soros, master world currency manipulator, about that."
"Have you heard the nasty hate the Bernie supporters throw around. Who in their right mind think dressing up as the KKK is a message of peace. Who the hell runs around call people racist and Nazi thinks that is a message of love. The left is the side of hate. Trump speaks of hope and strength.

How is a student club that supports the Republican front runner close to a active hate group? Trump is only candidate that treats women as individuals and not place the label of victim hood on them. Trump ""famous"" woman must be punished for abortions was a response to what if abortion were already illegal. If you break the law you should be punished ,(side note on the nonsense that pro life don't want to punish women for abortions is crap, A Tennessean woman is on trial for attempted manslaughter for a failed illegal abortion(bathroom abortion not at a clinic)).

That's the very same argument Fox Fiends make. For myself - I found idiots like Glenn Beck and former PBS talking head Steve Inskeep - to both be hopelessly and stupidly slanted.

You insisted that it was impossible that Trump could be nominated by the Republicans because all the Big Money people were supporting his opponents.

Then, you insisted that he couldn't possibly be elected because all the Big Money people and the intelligent college-educated people were supporting Hillary.

There weren't enough of them, either.

Another was the second victim of a female AST, shoot a native in Delta that even the other cop there thought was uncalled for.
I think felons and perps of domestic violence should lose all guns, that way our cops will be safer on the next call, it's no wonder some are so scared. We do have plenty of good decent police why put them in danger?
Maybe black people run because they know the entire ""justice system"" is stacked against them and they don't want to be beat or killed like their friends have been."

I don't believe that a raise on fuel tax by $ 1 would see those dollars going to increase Trooper patrol along the Seward highway.  First that would require a dedicated tax. Then it would require the legislature does not play with the funds by deciding any use of the tax for road safety qualifies for using the tax. For example: a project like say installing guard rails on the Dalton would be in the name of safety and the use of the tax found appropriate in Juneau.

Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was ""well timed"" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ""Wait!"" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ""Wait"" has almost always meant ""Never."" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied.""

Substitute ""homosexual"" for ""Negro"", and it rings true in this situation."

"One of the reasons why the USA has a written Constitution which includes the Second Amendment was that in the UK in the mid to late 18th century the liberty of Protestants to have arms for their defence within the rule of law, as well as the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, were being preempted by Parliament.

When the occupying British army attempted to enforce these usurpation on these colonies, it led to armed conflict.

Lesson learned - the right is now in the written Constitution which requires a supermajority and a complex procedure to amend.

It strikes me as somewhat offensive for a member of the House of Lords to deliver a lecture ""You have to ask what are people hoping to achieve and why they would want to take up arms in the way some Americans do and are permitted to lawfully. ""

In both WWI and WWII ordinary citizens surrendered their firearms to arm the British Home Guard and in some case the British regular troops."

"Doesn't make much sense to put Mnuchin out front to speak about the Trump response to Puerto Rico.  Nor, frankly, efforts at Tax ""reform"".

I don't get it.  Is Trump so low in the tank on effective spokespersons that he only has Mnuchin left?

 Are the other more calm-inducing and credible members of his Admin refusing to go out a be talking heads?  On disaster relief, I'd think the ""smart"" move would be to put one of the generals or that guy who was doing a lot of talking at the outset of the Texas disaster, out there to give a sober and technical analysis of the ground situation, deployment of resources, obstacles and capabilities.

Mnuchin has a ""let them eat cake"" problem.

Which also affects his effectiveness as a spokesperson on Taxes.

Plus, Mnuchin just does not present well ""optically"".  Doesn't inspire confidence on any level.  Must be smart, but as a messenger, is terrible.

"If Alaskan native groups were allowed to manage fish and game in Alaska they would hunt and fish until there was nothing left .  The reason they didn't destroy all the fish and game in the past is they didn't have the means to do it.  Instead of sticking to their traditions , they use modern tools like motorized boats , snow machines , four wheeler's and airplanes. Now they have the ability to hunt and fish until nothing returns if the law doesn't stop them.  Listen to their latest TV ad's claiming "" we like to think we don't hunt for the animals---they give themselves up to us "" . Or the ocean is "" their garden "" .  They took a whale that they didn't even know what type it was and village leaders told their people not to talk to officials investigating the case. They even boasted they wouldn't give back the meat if ordered to.  Without the feds and state managing fish and game we'd be in deep trouble."

Mr. Milner's focus on the comedy trappings of political discourse is interesting but also feels similar to me.  The only thing that keeps making sense to me about this media-digital-social-legal process we call politics in 2016 is that the negative aspects of it were completely loosed upon the populace by the Citizen's United Supreme court decision.

Most money gets channeled to the islands through, the military, tourist industry, welfare and Federal subsidies, residents with mainland entitlements and investments and some agriculture. Money is scarce in the village economy.

In the last week I've concluded that Trump is even more dangerous. He is delusional. He can't really be accused of lying or even BSing because he genuinely believes the ""alterative facts"" that he - and now, sadly, his henchpersons- spout.

-

No, not true.

Crime bosses generally have a good grasp of the responsibilities of their position and a skill set to execute those responsibilities.

Trump has neither.

The author has slurred all crime bosses.

"IRT SaveParadise, hey, dirt is discarded soil (was taught this in college), anyways, you bet it's true that Trump Jr. wanted to get ""Dirt"" on Ms Hillary.  The problem Trump Jr. got nothing.  The Russian attorney knew nothing, and wanted to gain support for lifting the ban on Russian adoptions.  More ""Fake News""."
"Google, your comment is sick.  You need to seek professional help for your mental disorder."
Brauchler is a jerk.  He spent huge amounts of Adams County money just to get a lot of news coverage for himself! Trying to get the death penalty was totally unnecessary.  The end result was the same despite B's grandstanding.
"Hmmm, the US federal government's history of managing healthcare seems to be spotty at best..."
Trump lies more often than he tells the truth. This is apparent to anyone who pays even a modest amount of attention to what is happening south of the border.

"I went to Mount St. Scholastica which merged with St. Benedict's College to become Benedictine College.  I don't believe it was reactionary then, but I was there DURING Vatican II and the sisters (most with doctorates) were excited about Vatican II.  They certainly prepared me well for the changes that went forward...

The merged college seems to have taken a hard right turn when it began having lay leadership...plus, it IS in Kansas, so politically, it probably fits right in with the surroundings."
Sarah the virulent self-righteous Trump hater is back!! What else is new in the world.
Looks like corporal 11 has decided to express his feelings through the reactions section rather than to comment. Can't blame him at some point you need to know when to throw in the towel. I mean how low can you go to continue to support a pathological liar.
"There's not much work to be done there! Trump has already fired himself! I appreciate the fact that he brought a lot of things to light, that plague our country but he just doesn't have the professionalism to carry it through. I've said that before, so now we wait at least 4 more years to have any hope of change. If folks are happy with a disintegrating middle class, little to no economic growth and an unemployment rate that doesn't tell the truth, they'll be happy with Hillary as president. Nonsense hasn't killed us for the last 24 years, so 4 more of the same can't be too bad."
"LOL...the whole planet sees he's an idiot, and you blame one news outlet?  Just got back from Taiwan two weeks ago.  My very close friends there, who are extremely polite and avoid criticizing anyone or anything, asked me in a very polite way what I thought of Trump.  I could tell they're amazed mow much of a moron he is."
You can disagree all you want but have enough guts to put your true feelings into heartfelt words or go crawl back into your cave. This sick f--- of a so called president is ruining our country and that's the bottom line. It looks like this white guy was targeting white people. It has gotten this bad.
"So, I would guess that the Kealoha's were hiding from the process server.  These two need to be in jail."
"This article is a textbook example of pushing negative propaganda about a foreign nation, in this case Russia. 

""...likely based in Russia."" Where? Who? How is that known?
""...divisive messages."" Such as what? 
""...potentially politically related..."" what does that even mean? 

How does this article inform the reader of anything substantive? 

I read these sorts of articles from the Globe and Mail - the very same newspaper that has engaged in a steady years-long campaign for for a full-scale western invasion of Syria, and escalating military force against Russia in the region - and I really wonder who is at the helm here and why they are trying so hard to convince readers to form a very particular worldview. This is Canada. This is supposed to be a Canadian newspaper."
That is a complete mischaracterization of what Wente said.
I guess the Assembly along with the mayor figured they could afford this after approving to raise the cost of gas by 10 cents a gallon. That tax expected to bring in $14 million. Your tax dollars at work to provide other people housing and small business a cheap place to call home.

"Over 75% of Canada's foreign trade is with the US and as we have recently seen (I'm referring to the Trump phenomena and the fact that, but for his bizaare personality, Canada would shortly be experiencing a frontal assault by his bullying tactics - and Clinton has been forced to follow suite) that this overreliance has its downsides.  

We share this weakness with Mexico and the two countries should cooperate to lessen that dependence."

This police officer has had 16 months off... With pay? You have got to be kidding me. Nobody else who assaults somebody goes 16 months before their case is concluded do they? If the video shows the cop assaulting the guy while he is handcuffed then the cop should be fired before he gets put in jail for a year.

"""But we are probably more tolerant than any Western nation""

That's ridiculous. You have twice the rate of hate crimes as the U.S. does. You are probably the only Western nation to be found to be denying the human rights of your own citizens. None of your minorities reach critical mass as far as pct of the population is concerned and as the writer of the article states, the majority in Canada is in firm control.  You're locking up your largest minority as a percentage of the population at a rate in excess of blacks in the U.S.
Your immigration policy would be unacceptable in probably every other Western country as it would be considered 'discriminatory'. Your 40000 recent immigrants were limited to families, homosexuals and orphans but they are bandied about as if your tolerance and inclusion is due to your genetics."

It will not happen and the EU will be better off w/o England and will be in better shape with Scotland and Ireland only as UK members. The common European Market will remain the biggest economic market even w/o England. And the Brit's know it .... this is the reason they have no concept yet how to exit the EU. I would not be surprised if England presents a late come back idea to remain in the EU.

There are  150.000+ British Citizen working in Germany, who  applied for the German passport after the BREXIT vote. All of them highly educated and loving it in central Europe. Are they all stupid ?"
"calling people racist, white supremacist and other derogatory names is dangerous and not true !

There is no proof for any of this and it seems the Liberals are very sore losers. If you think the president is a racist you need help !

That stated, will people stop insulting Alabama? I've been there many times and found it to be completely mischaracterized and misunderstood. It's a good state with really nice, hard-working people. It's nothing like any of these obnoxious, insulting posters would think if they actually went there for any period of time. I just don't like stereotypes like this. I don't assume New Englanders are all effete pinheads who haven't worked an honest day in their lives, so don't assume Alabama's full of jugheads, neither stereotype is true and they're usually offered by people who feel inadequate themselves."
"Obama was careful, perhaps too careful, to avoid the appearance of  being particularly concerned with the problems of the Afro-American community in the first 2 years after 2008.  However, the main reason why America did not make enough progress in resolving the legacy of slavery was Republican obstruction of anything Obama tried to do, especially after the 2010 mid-term elections.  Your blaming the black community for ""not taking personal responsibility"" echoes the stereotype that Blacks ""have  a chip on their shoulder."" Many Blacks actually do believe in the American myth that all social problems can be magically resolved by acts of personal responsibility and will. That myth may motivate some individuals to become successful but it cannot resolve deep-seated patterns of destructive attitudes and behaviour transmitted through generations, not only in the Black community but also in white hillbilly culture."

I think it is pretty daft & lazy to hop in a car, or one of those honkin' big trucks that have never carried more than a bag of groceries in the back that seem so ubiquitous in Anchorage, to go everywhere. I think it is even more daft when people using one of the most inefficient transportion models possible whine about traffic. Guess what? You are traffic. 

How much public space is dedicated to moving & storing cars, which are quite often used so one person can use a 2K lb + vehicle go a few miles?

"The surprise deal President Trump struck this week with Democratic congressional leaders is an agreement to continue the status quo on federal government funding through December.

That means three more months to fight against the Trumpist budget proposal, which would be truly devastating for ordinary families.

This has nothing to do with the radical left. Lets be honest. The left was never in charge of anything  here. All decisions made by the West relating to  the Middle east over all those years were done by the establishment looking after their economic interest spelled oil. Doug is certainly wrong on all account but he certainly does not represent a leftist- but the view of the establishment here.
"And just as fast as the workers disappear from the payroll list, they reappear on the unemployment and welfare rolls. Now that's a real plus in economics! If everyone just quits their job, we could reduce costs considerably, all around. Are you giving your job up? There are ways to improve economy and balance budgets, with out just putting people out of work. Our legislator's opted out of even trying to debate the issues, so if they lose their jobs, it would be just fine and might actually help us. At least the rest of the workers in this state are productive and work for their pay check rather than just getting all they can with out going to jail."

"Most of Trump support has nothing to do with bravado. There is no doubt the electorate focused on issues over style and personality. Trump stole the working class vote that the Democrats abandoned, championed the little guy while the Democrats focused on identity politics, feigned outrage and smug elitism.

ISIS is evil incarnate and Assad is a brutal dictator who gasses his own people and dumps barrel bombs on their apartments, creating a massive refuge problem affecting the entire world (and creating a new generation of terrorists).  It seems past time to acknowledge that Russia is on a war footing with the West and will respond only to force or severe sanctions."
"I watched the video of Trump's press conference and in response to a reporters question about a statement Sen McCain made, Trump said: ""What about the ""alt-left"" that came charging at us""....the ""us"" being the Nazi's, KKK, alt-right, white supremacists.....Freudian slip?"

Anyone with a basic understanding of science can review the best evidence presented by fluoridation opponents and see why it has been repeatedly rejected by the majority of science and health experts:
1) The study will have nothing to do with drinking optimally fluoridated water (OFW);
2) The study will deal with exposure to fluoride ions at far higher levels of exposure than found in OFW;
3) Actual conclusions have been deliberately distorted/misused/misstated to fit anti-F propaganda;
4) Conclusions will only be suggestion of a possible correlation without proper adjustment for other potential causes and they are proof of nothing;
5) The study will be unrepeatable;
&/or
6) the claim will be a complete fabrication.

Your interpretation of the ""Mexican study"" is an example.

Agreed.  A U.S. route for the Keystone pipeline should be abandoned.  It is imprudent and a waste of time to negotiate with the present American administration.  There is no certainty in dealing with whatever that administration may agree to.  The U.S. certainly is not entitled to 25% (or possibly a jacked-up royalty in the future) from Canadian resources being piped through the U.S..  Take the Keystone Pipeline to Vancouver Harbour from Alberta.  Apparently the Trans Mountain pipeline lacks the capacity to meet the needs of Canada's Chinese and other foreign clients.  They can come to Vancouver Harbour to pick up their oil as well as they could the Gulf of Mexico.

 Two months later and the total just keeps rising.  Mr. Trump is a habitual liar.  If you or I lied as much our family and friends would suggest we get counseling or therapy.  Mr. Trump is President and his lies could have serious consequences for our nation.  He's a very disturbed man.  Yet you and other Trumpsters insist on defending his lies and attempting to trivialize them with distractive references to President Obama, Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton.

In the DRC thousands of people are enslaved through a system of peonage to work in mines for rare earth minerals. The country has the vast bulk of the world's supply of these resources without which our electronics could not be made - yet it hasn't made the country rich, it has merely impoverished the people more because it's being mined by slaves.

In fact - there are more slaves (and I'm not counting sweat shop workers-  just old fashioned whips and chains slaves) in the world right this second  than were traded in the entire 300 year history of the trans-atlantic slave trade.

And 100% of the blame belongs to capitalism: the slavery happens because rich corporations won't pay the price suppliers have to charge who use honest labor."

If a flight is still overbook at boarding time, gate agents first ask for volunteers to give up their seats for certain compensation.  If that does not work and the flight is still overbooked, airlines are permitted by federal regulations to select the passengers who will not be allowed to board.   All of this should be done before anyone boards the plane.   This is all in accordance with Federal regulations.  The problem with the Dao case is that passengers were boarded and then asked to give up their seats.  That definitely was United's fault and the cause of the Dao incident."

I just keep repeating yes that's true. Had a chance Tulos contract of course I've written this dozens of times. Bringing people down it's just what I love to do!
"Ironically, one of the most outspoken hotels industry person of using the TAT to fund the White Elephant Rail project is none other than Mufi, our ex-Mayor, who started it all with his sleight of hand political doings to mislead the gullible public from the very beginning.  Don't forget too, that his point man on the project is now our present Mayor who learned well the practice of political deception from his past boss.  A further irony is that the hotel industry has been enjoying and touting their record profits for the past few years after raising room rates to some of the highest in the country.  Now they cry foul when tapped for funds and claim that the TAT levy may make a Hawaiian vacation so much less attractive and invite competition.  One might label them as self-serving hypocrites of the highest order ...  and sadly our politicians appear to be going along with it.  Sad."
"It amazes me how many people commenting would prioritize paying down a (less than 3% rate)  mortgage as opposed to making RRSP deposits to defer tax on a $100,000 plus income.

Their stated goal of a $84,000 after tax total household income, means that they each will be earning about $55,000 per year pre-tax income. Therefore he will be paying a tax rate in retirement that is much lower than his current tax rate.

There are more reasons than just the tax savings, of course, but the expert is right and thank goodness the posters who would advise paying the mortgage off first are not giving advice professionally."

"We know there are people who have stopped looking for work that are not part of this calculation. But even with that, where are the positive comments about this low unemployment rate? When the rate was high, people complained. So why not note something positive?

I have wondered how the figure includes or does not include those with two or more jobs. A lot of people are working more than one job in part because employers are hiring for part-time positions to  avoid paying benefits.

So while it's great to see the improved figures which would seem to be the result of the State's efforts and those of the Obama administration, there are a lot of problems such as low wages and the need to work multiple jobs to make ends meet that temper these improved numbers."

Also if there truly is a surplus, how come the Department of Transportation says they do not have any money to pay for needed road & highway repairs, including road improvement projects to fix the known Oahu chokepoints to reduce gridlock traffic when Universities & private schools are in session?  Rhetorical question,  they do not want to make major roadway improvement, EVEN when they had federal funds cause then it would highlight the total uselessness of the train & there is NO surplus when the train will end up costing taxpayers $20 BILLION (with interest) that will put Hawaii in perpetual debt.

And part of the problem is interrupters, who seem to deliberately sidetrack or attack.  This is selfish of me, but one of the problems is those who ""feed"" the disrupters by replying when knowing no decent discussion will result; another problem is long back-and-forths, each trying to get the last word.

"The commercial dynamics here seem obscure. Denel is ultimately a SA manufacturer of the products concerned.  Most such businesses, when seeking an export market will follow through various steps:
1. Travelling (but home-based) salesmen to drum up business.  Somewhat hit-and-miss in impact for large-scale contracts.
2. Strategically-placed commission-based agencies, with technical backup (when needed) from the manufacturer.  The agent is trusted to keep an ear open for possible contracts.
3. The establishment of a local sales office, owned by the principal. Only justifiable, once satisfactory business penetration is already established.
4. The establishment of local assembly / manufacturing centres.
The placement of Denel Asia and Denel India seems a premature attempt to dive straight in at the third stage without any preparation.  At present, the second is barely plausible as a business proposition.  As such, financial holdings and use of the company name seem questionable."

No one who is truly a Christian will, for example, ignore the hungry, sick and homeless while working to get a better deal for the wealthy.  We must not forget that in Nazi Germany many people who said they were ""Christians"" supported Hitler.  Today the servants of Satan find disguising themselves as Christians often gives them a 'free pass' to abuse the poor, most notably in state legislatures and on Capitol Hill.

My bet is he'll resign rather than face impeachment, and go back to firing people on TV and cheating employees out of their wages, two jobs he knows much better. He just cut a deal with the Saudis (the ones he blamed for 9/11) to sell them $100 billion in advanced arms for their attack on Iran in exchange for $200 billion in investments in the rust-belt.

Would really like to see the reasoning the judge used to declare the law a violation of US immigration laws.

What really happened? Fewer people working their proverbial tails off, coping with the stress of having to know a lot more than they used to and across a much broader field of knowledge. More time to think. HaHaHa! All to say ... be careful out there."

"If Humpty-Trumpty wants his wall to become his legacy, then have Mexico pay for it as he promised during the campaign. It does not belong in OUR budget. I don't want to help pay for Trumpty's wall anymore than I want to pay for Caldwell's rail.
POTUS will never admit to the stupidity of his idea, but he should take this golden opportunity and back off, then he can always blame the Dems for sabotaging his grand plan. It will just be another of his many campaign promises he has yet to fulfill, so nothing new there.
I'd rather see the money spent on taking apart MS-13; wall or not, the gang has been here and prospering for decades, even globally. I believe these are the ""bad hombres"" to whom POTUS has often referred,  and no wall is going to halt their proliferation. Focus on the ""hombres,"" not the ""dreamers."""

"Hi, bobtr900 - Like many people who blog here, I'm in an evidence-based profession. When someone makes a statement, I instinctively ask what their evidence is and whether it supports their hypothesis. I think when we were using DISQUS, most of us tried to explain our statements at some length, and it was fairly clear whether we had enough evidence to convince others. The limitations of Civil Comments constrain us to state opinions in few words, but don't allow for us to support them with evidence, especially if the opinions are complicated. The result is a disturbingly simplistic exchange of barbs that solves little, if anything. 

I think this is an incredibly dangerous time in our church and our world, and one that requires more than is being provided by NCR's essays or, increasingly, by our responses."
"Republicans are demonstrating that their protests about the process for the ACA's passage were entirely hypocritical. Now, as they hold the majority, they provided all of 90 minutes to read a 200 page bill before voting on it. No opportunity to discuss it among themselves beyond that. No opportunity to hear from the opposition. No hearing from experts or associations who would be directly impacted by the measure. Vote -- based on what the leadership says is in the bill."
"The lefty obsession with a $15 minimum wage has no basis in logic or reason. A more balanced approach would be to gradually increase the minimum wage, so that someone working 35 hours a week, 46 weeks a year could live at the poverty line, which in Ontario for a single person is about $21,857 p.a. Raise the minimum wage starting this year so that, indexed to inflation the minimum wage in 2022 would be $14.71 an hour or $23,682 p.a.. Announce the increases now and after 2022, legislate automatic increases tied to CPI. This is the type of logical balanced gradual approach that gives folks who need it more money, and businesses certainty and visibility and makes so much sense that it has not a hope in hell of being adopted by any political party"

"This issue will go away the moment we stop the police from murdering unarmed black people. Murdering unarmed black people may be part of white America's patriotic heritage, but it violates the Constitutional rights of the dead and their loved ones, in the 21st century. On the odd occasion that the courts find the killings unjustified, the police usually keep their jobs and pensions. They get time off with pay and counseling to recover from being a murderer. The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA. I guess killing black children is patriotic for some white folks. They are easier and safer to kill than unarmed black teens and adults. The children almost never fight back."

"Some really good points in this thread... one more perspective... we need to educate (or re-educate) the next generation and ourselves on HOW TO THINK. In my mind all news media outlets are biased - most are owned/controlled by corporate entities or very wealthy individuals (i.e. Breitbart and Washington Post). We , as citizens, owe it to ourselves and our Country to weed through the lies and make up our minds based on our thinking skills - and by interacting with each other in dialog (as Gary points out). Most importantly, we need to teach the next generation how to analyze, think, and come to reasonable conclusions. That is so much more important than worrying about centralized test scores."

Now go ask the tenants if any of those capital expenses are happening. Your ""stealing bread"" analogy is ludicrous."
"Might be a misnomer to suggest that CBD here is a ""sister compound"" to THC when the CBD oil present in these products will most-likely be derived from hemp oil and not cannabis oil.  Whether CBD hemp oil has the same/similar healing effects of CBD cannabis oil is up for debate.  

Some would suggest that CBD hemp oil lacks the full-spectrum (THC + turpines + CBD) that cannabis oil provides and is nothing more than ""snake oil.""   

I think clarity is needed here to better inform both the general population and patients seeking medical relief.  If Aloha Green is currently prohibited from the distribution and sale of medical cannabis - be it due to DOH delay - then, it is also certainly prohibited from the distribution and sale of manufactured marijuana products (like CBD cannabis oil) - that's HRS Chapter 329D (does DOH even have a permitting process for the manufacture?).

While, we, the people, are hanging around, desperate, for decent governance.  We don't wanna know, why these guys are so-called OK for the ANC or whoever.  We just want them to do their bloody jobs!

"As I posted a month or so ago, Vos Canadiens, decent team, top 10 and all that, but their record vs the better teams is horrid.  Something like 4-10-2 in regulation.  Oh, they get by the dregs of the league no problem, but cannot seem to get by Was, Pit, Clb, Min, and now Edm.

Edm, ppg, top 10 team.  Given what constitutes a good team in today's salary cap 30-team abomination, Edm qualifies.  And, of course, les gars did not beat them, though deciding a game on a SO is stupidity running supreme.

On any # of stats, Vos Canadiens are top 10, including goals scored.  There is talent there, but whatever they're doing to beat the dregs of the NHL, it's not working vs the superior teams.

Now, that would seem to indicate there's something with the style of play, the game plan, the tactics.  Caught part of the 3rd period, it was dreadful.  Hockey is up-tempo, it's speed, it's creating chances, head-man the puck, not what le tricolour does.

"What an unfortunate ad hominem attack by Nicole Grant. We all have blemishes. If Nicole is dragging this race into the mud then here are some factual, background questions:

2. Has Teresa ever done the very hard work of signing up unorganized workers from a non-union workplace into a union? Represented union members' grievances under a collective bargaining agreement? Negotiated a collective bargaining agreement? Organized a strike? Done anything other than elite, high-level, top-down lobbying of corporate Dems? How much of this non-lobbying work has Nicole done, and for how many years?

3. Why is Teresa's campaign paying Christian Sinderman, a politico synonymous with the establishment?

At least Jon Grant worked for a housing justice non-profit, dependent on grassroots organizing and a shoestring budget."

"The so-called reduction is much less than the media is giving Wynne credit for.
Recall last year, that there was a 10% subsidy that has since been discontinued. This was replaced with a 8% subsidy (by removing provincial portion of HST). So this so-called 10% reduction is actually a 2% increase compared to last year. Then add to this the additional cap and trade increase that took effect in January (about an 8% increase, and you are left with an overall increase about 2%+8% = 10%. Now they are talking about changing amortization to reduce the bill by 15%. The net effect, the savings are just +10% - 15% = 5%. Yet they are marketing this as a 25% reduction. I wish the media would call this for what it is -- a paltry 5% reduction!"
"This shows you the peril when you allow another country to control your domestic housing market, which is what has happened here in metro Vancouver.

For years Vancouver has been the least affordable city in North America to purchase a house vis a vis income, and sits in the top three worldwide. (Sorry Toronto - not even close).  Because of the commodification of housing, driven by overseas earned/sourced money, the City of Vancouver has over 10,000 sold and empty housing units. Adjacent Richmond's downtown centre has 47% of it's housing units sitting sold and empty.

The same commodification is seen in other cities popular with overseas money., like Melbourne with 60,000 sold and empty homes.

Of course China takes the prize with an estimated 60 million sold and empty housing units.

Canada has chosen to do nothing to curb the sale of it's housing stock overseas.  China attempting to curb the flight of it's capital is a good thing for Canada. Although ""attempt"" is the operative word."

It can be a very challenging and unforgiving environment.  You speak about the whales being endangered, but WHY are they endangered?  Not because the Inuit peoples have hunted the whales for centuries to sustain themselves, but because YOUR past relatives hunted the whales to near extinction for whale oil, and nothing else.  I have been around and spent time with Native Alaskans, and whether it is Moose, Whale or any other animal, I have found them to be very respectful of the animal and the environment.  It is a part of their culture; a culture that has existed for centuries.  The Native Alaskans haven't raped and pillaged the planet, WE are the ones who have done so, with our desire for modern conveniences.

We can then sustainably draw a defined amount from the Earnings every year to the tune of $2.5 billion to pay most of the cost of State government. THERE is YOUR dividend! Oil tax reform is also mandatory. Once that is complete, we may also need a broad based tax. I prefer the income tax over a State sales tax. The dividend amount must be phased down: $1,000 then $750 then $500 then $0. So three more years of dividends before an income tax is necessary. There you go Governor -  a better plan than yours."

"Prepare for the end of the bull market they said....in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017

Saying to prepare for equity market fall before it happens sounds really smart until you realize nobody knows when it is going to happen. It's obvious and, simultaneously, completely worthless advice unless you have a crystal ball. 

Remember when the first Fed rake hike in December of 2015 was end of equity markets? Does anybody care to calculate the gain on the S&P since then?

Listen to these fools at your own expense."

Why has it taken over 2 years to come to an indictment?  He confessed to his Brother, he called the police and turned himself it and the body was in the back seat of his car.  Are the Alaska crime investigators that inept that they could not find evidence?  Now even with the 'deal' it will take until April, another 4 months to sentence a confessed killer?

The simple answer is a broken system.  A system where the criminal has more rights than the honest citizen.  Yes, if there is only circumstantial evidence, there needs to be time given for the facts to come out, but in cases like this, Justice is a total joke!  Justice has been supplanted by Lawyers and Judges intent on garnering mega dollars while they plug the system with cases which should take no more than 6 months!  Thus guaranteeing job security!

SB91?  Has nothing to do with Justice, it is all about money going to the right people!"

America has refused to sign a peace treaty with North Korea ever since a truce between them was declared in 1953. They are still technically at war.  The North Koreans are virtually surrounded with overwhelming American firepower just twitching to be used. If the US wanted peace it would have had talks with NK a long time ago. Kim may be a brutal dictator but Donald Trump is a loose cannon controlled by the American war machine.

"If I recall correctly, several continued to board the bus even as he approached me, so the bus was not yet in motion. So I doubt he lost his balance as he walked in a straight line, only to veer slightly off course just a split-second before impact. And after elbowing me he made what sounded like a snide remark by the tone in which he said it even if I could not make out audibly what he said. Perhaps he may have apologized, yet the snarky tone reeked sarcasm like that of a sociopath. Being that it was about a year ago, he may have weighed closer to 325 pounds--yet still massive enough to have caused me to be placed on CTE concussion protocol had he intended to do so had he not held back. So there could also be the possibility that he simply wanted to knock a supposed chip off my shoulder but ended up knocking my block off instead. An unforgettable experience nonetheless."

"I agree with you Mr. McTeague. I tried to do the math several times and it just doesn't add up. There is no doubt that there are fraudulent cases that don't get caught, but with a population of a little over 700,000 and a PFD of $1,000 the numbers just add up to begin to pay for a $650,000 contract, let alone save the state money. We'd have to have at least 25% of the applications be fraudulent just to cover the contract cost, and I think that is highly unlikely."

I have no problem telling the Broncos goodbye and good riddance because the flag and the people who have died for it are way more important than watching a bunch of overgrown jerks chasing a ball around.

"As mentioned before by PR2 The American Way of Death points to a broader context that perhaps should be more emphasized: the outlandish costs of Funeral Home burials.  The Funeral Consumers' Alliance has affiliates in most states that list options that undercut the funeral business. They list many choices for cremation, which can then be followed by Church services and burials in a small plot. I had never heard about burial pods. They would indeed be more ecologically responsible, but wonder what costs would be involved. But I do think burials should be within the sphere of family tasks, reflecting the faith or lack thereof of the deceased and their families, decreasing for-profit intermediaries. Once my uncle, who ran a paper box company, developed a strong, paper coffin. He presented his prototype to the National Association of Funerary Services, but soon learned that they in nowise wanted an inexpensive casket-free option. Caskets are a major source for profits."

"1/4
The only way Trump was not lying when he made the original assertion is if he believed right-wing rants that were not sourced and provided no proof or evidence. In that case, he's reckless and irresponsible -- which of course he is. In the meantime, every person and agency that has looked into his false accusation has concluded that Obama did not -- indeed could not -- do what Trump accuses (not 'accused', but accuses) him of doing. And so if the original accusation was born of stupidity, the continued repetition of the accusation is lying. (Or profound mental illness, which I cannot exclude.)  In any event, he's pedaling a falsehood.  A prestigious newspaper yesterday likened Trump to a drunk clinging to an empty bottle of gin."
"That is a remarkably ideological response. I can point to quite a few examples of ""bullying"" and name-calling by Clinton and  her supporters during this campaign and afterwards. Apparently, when Clinton and her supporters throw baseless accusations and insults around and use derogatory terms to unfairly label millions of people they don't know, they are just expressing their right to free speech, but when Trump supporters respond to these attacks and provocations, even in thoughtful and articulate ways, they are simply being bullies... This is a ridiculous and self-serving double standard. There are quite a few articulate and well educated Trump supporters out there, and many good people who supported Trump who do not deserve the condescending disdain of certain Clinton backers, who have appointed themselves as part of some sort of imaginary ""elite"", even though in many cases they don't seem to have any particularly great qualifications and likely couldn't run a lemonade stand."

The intent, I'm sure, was not only to treat me disrespectfully but to let those seeing the incident know that they're not worthy of respect either.

As for the KKK guy, all KKK are white supremacists, whom I have already denounced. Sorry if that was somehow not clear to you. Finally even WaPo reports the truth that has been available for everyone with eyes: Antifa is a violent and dangerous group, with willingness to use violence and intimidation at its core. We don't need anyone supporting their actions. I don't understand why police apparently have not arrested those involved when they broke up fights. We'll get rid of the neo-nazis and white supremacists (probably never all, but most) through public dialogue and reason. Or jail them if they get violent."
"Well, logically, it makes more sense to look at votes in the swing states as that was where the election was decided.

"The distinction is that the neo-Nazis, kkk, and white supremacists don't like people because of the color of their skin.  The Antifa does not like the neo-Nazis, and white supremacists because of the content of their character.  Do you not see that?"

"The problem with any government subsidized plan, big or small, is that 100's of millions, even billions, in taxpayer dollars are going straight into the profit column of private insurance companies instead of going to help people.  Money that should be going to pay for healthcare is being used to buy some exec at Aetna his 3rd home in Aspen. 

The only way to get the situations under control is single-payer government insurance, combined with legislation to stop the profiteering by pharmaceutical giants and healthcare providers. Leaving our healthcare in the hands of people who have a vested interest in not keeping you healthy is a really terrible idea. Also, don't ever let anyone say we can't afford this, we have more then enough money.  Presently our lawmakers are funneling massive sums of money into worthless pork-barrel projects that we don't need, especially in the realm of defense spending.

"Rubbish.  The entire surface area of the reservoir is 4,000 Ha, or 40 square kilometres, (20 Km  x 2 Km.) That's roughly double the surface area of the river at present.

If that will feed 1 million, the balance of Peace River Ag land can feed almost 140 million Canadians. 

Alternative energy sources? A  windmill has a 20 year lifespan. A dam's electrical generation capacity is approximately 100 years.  The Paris accord requires CO2 cuts of 30% by 2030, the transportation sector which contributes 27% of CO at present, must be electrified. The claim that we can rely on the Columbia River (USA) dam's capacity is foolish. When Trump says America First, it means everyone else last. The only energy security we can count on is our domestic supply.

"The setting of war is not even close to the same analogy as the comfort and protection we/you expect to have in our communities.  The rules of engagement vastly differ... We rely on law enforcement to assist us in providing a safe environment to live, work, play and raise a family.  Yes, losing a loved one you know that went to go fight and die in a war is painful, but the military's main focus is to maintain readiness for wartime. A law enforcement officer's job is to uphold the law and attempt to maintain law and order with the minimal force necessary to gain compliance.  What's tragic is some folks like to push the envelop and when that happens, usually someone get hurt and/or killed.  Unfortunately sometimes that is our police officers/troopers.  This is why we must ensure this legislation passes... cops are the line in the sand against criminals and the first entity we call when the crap hits the fan at home and in our communities.

"This makes sense since physicians played a huge role in creating the problem in the first place.

Many years ago I worked as a product representative for a major pharmaceutical company.  My job mainly consisted of calling on general practice doctors in their offices to try to convince them to write prescriptions by name for my company's products.

"year after year this criminal dysfunction continued, and knowing it was going on the county board, city council and RG editorial board covered it up and promoted LCFM through Orwellian fraud. As is the repeated pattern throughout this policy history, all whistleblowers are DOA at the RG. It finally became so vulgar not even the social swine at LCFM could handle the stench coming off their social pig sty, and the city council finally removed their director who took the fall for doing LCFM corrupt board of directors criminal dirty work, and the city council placed a community babysitter over them the county had called for 12 years earlier to assure this obnoxious criminal dysfunction did not continue like it did. While the city and county have put lipstick and a dress on this social swine, you still have a pig that cannot remotely pass legal scrutiny. The hypocrisy is staggering. (to be continued)"

"""Any firearm can be used to hunt.""

Ha! :-) 

OK, I think you know what I am referring to.  Typical hunting weapons.  Typical defensive weapons such as pistols and many high powered semi-automatic weapons that hold high capacity magazines.  Or perhaps any fire arm regardless should be taxed since in the end people commit suicide and kill with weapons of all types.  Knives and archery type weapons excluded even though those can be used to kill as well.

Not only is Trudeau the first prime minister in Canadian history to ever be under investigation by the conflict-of-interest and ethics commissioner for breaking our federal laws but he's also under investigation by the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages. He managed to get away with physically shoving around a female politician in the House of Commons and for breaking our immigration laws by not deporting Monsef for illegally entering Canada under a falsified application after deporting hundreds of others for the exact same reason. If Trudeau had a shred of moral integrity, he would step down."

Cities will be going in this direction so get used to it. No one disagrees that a cyclist will be the loser in a collision so there's no need to ""just say"" Most cyclists are also drivers so they see it from both perspectives. Perhaps ""ignorant drivers"" was a bit strong but I don't think that pushing cycling infrastructure aside because it is an inconvenience is the appropriate solution.

"Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago.

Trump never had any foreign policy, other than looking to skim money wherever he could.

"I appreciate the attempt to counter the claim with data, but it should be noted that your data is not a count of rapes, but of reported crime. The discrepancy is that rapes are under-reported as crimes. Some rapes are also falsely reported and falsely self-reported. 

Regardless, while determining the exact fraction of women that have been raped is important, the range set by your numbers (1 in 15 perhaps) and the story's (1 in 6) are both too high."
"I only had to read a few lines to realise that the author is entirely missing the point. 
Nobody, and let me emphasise that, is suggesting that people of colour are innately disposed to committing sexual offences. The (legitimate) concern is that a large percentage of migrants or refugees come from poor countries where women are not afforded the same rights of levels of respect when compared to men. Cultures where women, particularly Western women, are reduced to submissive objects of sex. 
You see, it's people like you who actually make this problem worse - you stifle any real debate surrounding the  issue by immediately condemning it as ""racist"". We can't talk about high migrant crime rates without some idiot calling us intolerant, thinking they are being really clever and progressive in the process. It is the opposite; by reducing this to something so simplistic as ""race"" you are doing a disservice to both migrants and host populations. We need to be able to discuss this openly."
"And speaking of this, EWTN did a fluff interview yesterday with Sebastian Gorka about his ""Catholic faith.""  As some might be aware, Gorka has ties with Hungarian neo-Nazis, a party called Jobbik.  Imagine what would happen if EWTN did a fluff interview with Joe Biden about his Catholic faith.  It's sad that EWTN doesn't take the intrinsic evil of racism with the same seriousness that it does abortion.  

When will the bishops speak of and condemn Trumpism as anti-Catholic?  If they actually had a backbone, ""Catholic"" officials like Gorka would be excommunicated for their promotion of bigotry rather than being interviewed on Catholic TV channels."

"The polls show a like of the person but a dislike of the policy  at a time when he has absolutely no real leader of the opposition through much of the legislative session.

More importantly, there is an incredible disconnect between Trudeau and the average Canadian helped, in part, by the media itself: he does not sit down to discuss policy with the media, preferring to make his statements in the scrum for a short period on the one day a week he has deigned he should be in the House of Commons. Until the media starts demanding more than one press sit down every six months and really addresses the issues, he will be judged on his public appearances instead of what he actually does."

"Looking back at our political history in British Columbia it's very noticeable that this era of the B.C. Liberals led by Christy Clark have been dull indeed.  Yes, the NDP haven't been in power for years at a time, but just think of what Dave Barrett and his government did during their term in office:
They created the Agricultural Land Reserve, ICBC, improved Workman's Compensation,, ended corporal punishment in B.C. Schools and introduced the Hansard Records to the Legislature.  There's so much more because social justice motivated everything they did and once again I can't help mentioning the Clark government's shutting down of Legislative Sittings......The Barrett-led NDP would never have considered such a thing....they were busy working for British Columbians in a passionate way."

He demolished the ""Russian-Concussion"" baloney!  He is wiping out the democrats.  And the baby snowflakes are melting.  All of this in just 5 months!"
"Alaska is in deep trouble if you get elected.  You'll never consider and do what's best for all Alaskan's  , you'll always do what's very best for union members.  That's the current problem with the Anchorage assembly . They put union member's interests ahead of what's best for the taxpayers.   You are the last type person we need in elected office because everyone knows who you will always put first.  There's no way you'll make the needed cuts to the state budget . You'll be part of the problem---not the solution."

I recently tried to get through to a particular member of staff at Standard Bank Claremont branch via their call centre. This was a follow up to an actual visit to the Branch a few days earlier. After 15 minutes of trying I gave up. The operator kept telling me that none of the extensions that she tried at the Branch were being answered. This included the Branch Manager. I then tried their CT Head Office. Nothing. I eventually paid another visit to the Branch to sort out my problem

This still less than Australia which will likely be at $40 billion at least per year by 2028, understandable as they don't have a superpower next-door t pick up the slack.  Canada will never fund this because social handouts and multiculturalism take priority over defence of the nation which is pathetic."
"What I lament about Leaf haters on this thread is their complete inability to make reasoned judgement calls or analysis.  In the last 50 years, 17 different clubs have won the Stanley Cup.  Through some or all of that period, 13 different clubs have demonstrated complete incompetence, the Leafs being an obvious leader in that category but not the sole recipient of such a moniker.  More importantly, the ups and downs are evident by all clubs over the years.  Being able to understand the nuances of emerging improvement or not is key.  That ability is lost on the haters.

I lived in Boston 2001, 3 years before their WS win, lived in Chicago several years before their 92 final and at a different time a few years ago before the Cubs win this past year.   Knowing how to recognize the early trends of a potential winner takes reasoned judgement, something lacking by posters who lambast passionate Leaf followers.

The fools are evident by their blind hatred.  Time will decide their validity."

@Milamarc I agree with your statement. It is true that bombardier to survive in aerospace should have space or military subsidiary. The only caveat I have with Bombardier (as I do with SNC or any other large Quebec corp) they are a poorly managed business in almost every way and rather than pulling up their pants and cleaning house they stick there hands out and the government folds.

In 1922, the Associated Press report was posted in The Washington Post. In it, they claimed:
The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer, and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot. Reports from fishermen, seal hunters, and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coastal cities uninhabitable.

Hardly degrading the presidency, Trump is taking it from the pedestal from which it doesn't belong in the first place. Even if this opinion had any string of truth to it, the worthless president we had before him actually degraded the COUNTRY through endless appeasement to the radical left (of which he belonged), radical Islamic terrorists, no sense of urgency for getting American people back to work, increasing the national debt two fold over Bush, causing the refugee crisis, (of course of which Reich declined to mention), encouraging the Arab Spring debacle, aiding and abetting Iran with their nuclear weapons program, (just as Clinton did with North Korea and look at it now), began a whole new entitlement program (Obamacare) prefacing it with nothing but lies and inflated claims, that the middle class are now paying for (crushing them).

"CIA seemed split on that one.  White House/Bush toady & CIA Director George Tenet claimed a ""slam dunk"" case for Iraq having WMD.  He sat beside Colin Powell when the latter was presenting his ridiculous case for the same at the UN.

The problem was you had to sort through info, decide who was legitimate, understand what the role of UN weapons inspectors really was - not drink the faecal soup handed out by networks like FOX.

"Mr. Gessler twists the perspective of the teachers' unions to portray a boogie man more frightening than any other monster we will soon see in Halloween costumes.  Teachers' unions want to protect the neighborhood schools and the resources for those schools.  85% of American students attend a neighborhood school but Americans are stingy about financing public schools. Families choose homes based on the neighborhood school.  
When reformers talk about school choice, they do not mention giving district more resources to properly finance those choices, but the effect (intended or not) is to dilute resources for all the students - those whose parents have the ability to explore all the choices and those whose parents need to focus more on survival due to their socio-economic status.  Teachers' unions speak for the latter group of student when we stand up for all students."

I'm trying to have a rational conversation here without taking sides.  There are cultural issues in play here that aren't being talked about, and the Democratic party engineered them, I believe, to keep blacks poor and dependent on Democrats.  It's called the poverty trap.

After WWII, the unemployment rate for black men fell steadily up to 1965.  When the welfare programs started, the black unemployment number leveled off and the number in poverty began to increase because it paid better.  The blacks were set up to fail by the Democrats.  They created a situation that made crime the logical thing to do."

Poor kids don't go to Harvard and drop out. All these guys came from wealth and all had a propensity toward education. They also had a certain amount of capital available to them and the ability to make financial mistakes and recover. They're an anomaly of an anomaly of an anomaly. 10 out of 318.9 million Americans does not prove the case you are trying to make that getting an education is a waste of time. My thought is you're wrong and too ignorant to know what you're talking about. It reminds me of when you talk about abortion. You know nothing. You're a know-nothing.
"I know officers who retired with 35 years on and were never promoted above MPO II.  Some choose their destiny.

He'll do his job to the best of his ability.  While some were playing the game and looking the other way as well as helping to frame people, McCarthy stayed out of it and took the high road.  

I'm glad he's finally getting the promotion that he has earned."
Are you really this immature?
Fair would be if all the gov't employees contributed to private sector/business owners defined benefit pension like the private sector/business owners do for them.  50% of a gov't employee's pension is paid by the taxpayer yet they complain it isn't fair if a business owner has a couple of tax breaks to help them save for retirement.  Wonder who actually costs the tax system more at the end of day and at the end of their lives.
"The sense among others, though, is of not belonging, no matter what the weather.

He said he was struck by the looks he got.

Mr. Blaine, you have to also be aware of the looks that you are giving. For there to be a mutual respect, you have to give it. From the picture you seem like your entitled to the park and your not.

"Steven, we need to be a bit more circumspect here, surely? 

It's only treason if Trump colluded with the Russians. Its perfectly possible the Russians did it entirely on their own initiative for their own purposes. All that Russian contact could have been stupid supports trying to make nice with the Russians with a view to making the world a saver place, but the Russians were using all that contact ""to play"" those supports for their own ends. That's naive, not treasonous. 

Me, I figure either (1) the Russian do have something on Trump, perhaps salacious, perhaps financial, or (2) Flynn has something on Trump, perhaps no more than that he (Flynn) was meeting with the Russians under Trump's orders for a very wide range of purposes that Trump would rather keep secret."

As for your bank, if it is setting liquidity/capital requirements you should let Morneau know because that is a legitimate factor that may not be accounted for in the changes. 

However, since banks will use your personal assets to guarantee your company's debts it seems to me more like an accounting exercise than a real concern."

"Horgan thanked her for her public service but not for serving the public, that is a key distinction. Clark was in public service for personal gain and notoriety and not to serve the public. 

Clark certainly wanted the job regardless of what anyone thought of her. She would do or say anything to maintain her grasp on power and personal fame. She most recently demonstrated her complete lack of integrity when she created the self-serving throne speech after the election loss. Other examples are too numerous to list.

"Plato condemned homosexual relationships as contrary to nature. What are you smoking and where can I get it?  Good grief! 

What Plato considered to be the highest form of love was a non-sexual relationship between men, especially older and younger men.  The reason is because Plato had little use for sexuality.  He felt it was irrational and animalistic.  He felt it had nothing to do with real love.  The deep friendship between men was founded upon the desire to seek truth, beauty and knowledge, not sexuality.  

Gay marriage was as senseless to the Greeks as it is to many today--because the Greeks understood marriage as having the purpose of propagating the species and founding families.  Homosexual acts between men were accepted in Greek society, but no Greek thought gay marriage made any sense.  

Polygamy most certainly is not ""Biblical"" if by ""Biblical"" you mean to say that God condones these kind of relationships.  What drugs are you on?  Whatever they are, they must be good."
"I've seen several articles similar to this one, and each time have struggled to understand the difficulty in choosing to vote for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton. 

I don't what it was like to grow up and be told that because of my gender, I could not aspire to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or even President. But I do know what it was like to grow up poor, and to be told that because of it, my dreams were unrealistic too. I could never cast a vote for Hillary Clinton, and that has nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman, but everything to do with the fact that she is not a progressive. Hillary was one of the last people to show her support for marriage equality, she was one of the last liberals to denounce NAFTA and TPP, she supported the war in Iraq, and she takes a significant amount of money from special interest groups. 

If you are a progressive, I hope your head wins. I agree it is time for a woman to reach the White House, but I don't think that means it's Hillary's turn."

"""VFJ's court advocates are only allowed to sit in court with the client and offer emotional support.""
Source?  Even the definition provided for ""advocacy"" indicates more than mere ""emotional support"" but ""process of supporting a cause or proposal"" so I don't get where you derive this marginalization of scope in ""court advocacy"" especially when that more reasonably falls under ""accompaniment.""  VFJ seems to consider the two distinct enough to list them as two different services, ie. ""Court Advocacy and Accompaniment,"" yet you conflate the two together."

"I'd agree with you-- but those guns eventually get smuggled in SWOntario (and other places of course, just saying b/c of user name). And then it becomes our problem. 

It's true that we can't vote for change (fortunately, or we'd be governed by the 2nd amendment too), but it is also our debate, because we're affected. And we're also affected because Canada has its own gun advocates who are always trying to make a similar case as American supporters for legalization. To defend our own country from this scourge, we need to be talking about it."
"Can you imagine the outcry if it was the president of Russia or China threatening the complete annihilation of a country and tens-of-millions of people?

"aren't there private pay care homes that would take them together?  this issue seems kind of foolish.  we have to protect Medicaid folks who need care and cannot pay themselves.  on the surface it may seem discriminatory, but it would be more discriminatory if they were allowed together in one home displacing a Medicaid patient.  there must be other alternatives.  they must have sufficient resources if they can afford private pay."
Interesting how the Democrat liberals turn the other cheek to the corrupt Clintons. It seems the protesters are  bogus lot that can't accept they lost.

"It is clear by your assertion that you have NOT performed a comparative doctrinal study yourself since you believe they are not similar.

"Yeeess.... and if those that don't want it live on the street, what then?

"Anyone who thinks Conway did this and did not hear ""Your Fired"" for her masters lips probably voted for Trump.

"Personally, I think any party that can win 3.5% of the popular vote should have official party status. Even if they don't win a single seat. Official party status comes with 12 seats now. So, one could award two seats to the BQ and eleven to the Greens; members at large.

I share Mr Trudeau's concern about Fringe parties. But we have only 5 parties that have polled more than 3.5% in the popular vote. And frankly, if a fringe party could muster those numbers, I'd rather they had minimal representation so we could all see what they were like.

The Tea Party has largely taken over the Republican Party and the GOP has given those fringe fanatics a patina of respectability. Better the nutty Right & Left be brought into the light of day than be allowed to poison the main parties of thought."
"No. Their chant is legitimate and valid.  Notley lied to the voters and she is working against their best interests.  And under the ""rules"" there's nothing anyone can do about it until the next election.  Therefore, the people are perfectly entitled to express their opinion.   

The only people who are unethical and stupid are politicians like Notley and Trudeau who lie to get elected and then ignore their promises to voters in order to satisfy political special interests.  They've turned the political system into one big unethical and illegal lie.  What do expect people to do?  Accept the injustice and be silent about it?  You can if you want.  But others chant ""lock her up""."

"I know this idea sends shivers down some people's spines, but, what if the Catholic Church, under the guidance of the Spirit decided to completely un-couple participation in Holy Communion from sinfulness?  Would that be so bad?  I personally can't find a single instance in the gospels where Jesus requires advance contrition from anyone before he bestows his presence and willingness to commune with them.  Indeed, it is the ever present question from the Pharisees, ""Why do you eat with sinners?"".  Why not return to Jesus' powerful and welcome all to the table, perhaps even encouraging the worse of us to step forward first?  I wonder if that would solve many, many problems."

The Trump Bots are also responsible: They elected a man who admits to sexually assaulting women, defrauds people, cheats contractors out of their promised pay, a pedophilic Peeping Tom, a traitor who colluded with the Russians, who cares more about enriching himself than taking care of the people of America, a sneering, hateful, pathological liar of the worst kind."
"100% Jane Fonda !

Thank you for taking the time and effort to overcome the foolish vilification you have been subjected to by the climate denialists here in Alberta & around the world.

I was in the oilpatch of western Canada for some eighteen years as a consulting wellsite geologist.

We did not realize at the time just how serious the climate threat was.

Those who continue to promote business as usual are science illiterate - or married to money.

No more pipelines !

The threat of extinction or collapse is entirely real, and the course we are on is one of accelerating towards what may well be called a tipping point.

We are going to need not new pipelines - but direct air capture on a very large scale - in my opinion without doubt.

For the sad truth is that we will stay on this suicide path for some time yet - and by the time we wake up as a society it will be too late for natural processes to prevent disaster."

"Why are cat-lickers and so-called ""animal rights"" zealots ALWAYS obsessed with any imagery of human male genitalia? Often the very first thoughts of theirs that they feel the need to, and are compelled to, project to the world. Why is that?

I surmise it is because anything with male genitalia has avoided being near these unwanted cretinous fools throughout their whole sad, sorry, and meaningless lives. They are obsessed with thinking about what they can never ever have in life.

Someone wise once said, ""Dear single girls, please stop saying you should give up and get a cat. If no man wants you please don't force an innocent cat to live with you either.""

(Though, due to the overwhelming preponderance of man-hating lesbians who ""love"" cats and use their cats to try to assert some kind of misguided authority in their ineffectual lives, I suppose that should be edited to say, ""If no human wants you ..."")

"The overwhelming majority of Canadians supported not allowing Jewish refugees in the 1930s. I think opinion have changed since then. 

As for the niqab, I agree that it is in violation of the Canadian belief system. So are Amish or Mennonite values. But I don't have a problem with how those communities behave.

Finally, how many of these regressive countries have you visited? Or has your knowledge been gathered from provocateurs like Margaret, or news channels like Fox and Breitbart?"
"Yes, easily. My objection is databases. In order for massive public surveillance to be of any use whatsoever, the surveillance itself must be retained in a database, likely linked and coordinated with other databases.

In the end, what this means is that the government (intentionally or not) is compiling a comprehensive picture of the everyday activities of innocent people. That picture is comprehensive enough to constitute a serious invasion of privacy, including things about you that aren't otherwise publicly available. And, when these cameras are placed in public, it removes consent.

This is why I strongly object to public surveillance cameras, but have much less of an issue with cameras on private property or in private businesses. Most businesses do not retain their footage for very long, let alone database it, and I can opt out of being a part of it by not going to those businesses. My consent is retained."

"Sorry, but I have to disagree.

In no way is renewable energy currently capable of replacing the energy needs of the world! Maybe in the future as the technology of renewables continues to progress, but right now renewables are not capable. Hope is eternal and I support that, but we're dealing with the here and now.

It's bottom-up, not top-down (don't tell me what I should use , show me the facts), many people don't want to make a lifestyle change or pay higher prices. Many consumers know you can't replace all the fossil fuels used by them with renewables at anywhere near the price, convenience or reliability of fossil fuels.

That may be a conundrum to some, to others it's just simple fact!"

Cops respond - respond - after - after - someone calls 9-1-1. And it takes time for the police operator to take the call, get the information, send it to the dispatcher, and for the dispatcher to air the call and the cops to drive there.

"Republican president Lincoln described our form of government as ""of, by, and for the people,"" yet Republicans are usually the first to erupt in protest if such government is actually proposed (usually by left-wing democrats). As long as we are required by our pay-to-play system to choose the lesser evil from two major (if similar) parties we will be, ipso facto, ruled by evil. We've talked about democracy for hundreds of years. Why not try it? Most government decisions are not NOT crisis in nature, and we COULD make them by majority rule. With off the shelf technology (properly watchdogged by representatives who would no longer be our masters but our servants) we could make decisions with less influence by special interests whose largess  to sympathetic or compliant candidates gives them more influence than the majority. The elite LOVE this partisan hoopla between wings of the corporate war party because no matter whether you vote D or R, the rich win. They own both parties."

The administrative branch has little to no influence on the legislative operations budget. 
I agree that with current world natural gas prices the pipeline is just a dream. 
As for purchasing the Wells Fargo building I think it definitely sends a message to all Alaskans that the legislature has no desire to address fiscal problems and just keep the gravy train rolling. No need to remodel the teller stations other than have new name placards with legislators names on them so they can take Alaskans cash for their own benefit.
One thing I haven't seen yet is the cost to renovate the Wells Fargo building. I believe the prudent action would have been to move into the Atwood building."

And now they are rats jumping off the Titanic just before they hit the iceberg they've been watching for a couple hours.

 Katrina was a catastrophe in which a city of a half million was drowned under ten feet of water for weeks, killing 1800 people or more.  The floods in Louisiana, while deadly, are a recurring event for the Mississippi basin.  A score of people may drown, every time.  Katrina was unique, highlighting the vulnerability of a major city built below sea level.

In terms of optics, Obama should have put aside his golf game, got on Marine 1, and flown into the flood zone, shook hands and hugged babies.  That's one of my exasperations with an otherwise good president, that he doesn't like to get down with the crowd when it counts.  If only he would hire me as an advisor, and I would do it for a hundred a day and expenses, and it would be worth it to him, if I say so myself."

"Congrats on your hypocrisy....

In the Northern Interior, the McLeod Lake Indian Band is expected to claim royalties of between $35 million and $40 million over the 15-year life of Thompson Creek Metals Mount Milligan gold and copper mine. The Nakazdli will share an additional $24 million in royalties from the mine.

In the Lower Mainland, the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh last year negotiated a 50-per-cent stake in a federal land deal that includes the Jericho military lands valued at $300 million. Once developed, estimates peg the Jericho real estate at $3 billion.

And the Tahltan expect to receive $2.36 billion in benefits during the next 60 years from the three AltaGas run-of-river projects for agreements covering revenue-sharing from the province and company, contracts, ownership and upfront payments. Community members have been told another $78 million could flow from the Red Chris mine."
I do not trust media or government versions. There are always two sides to a story and usually the corporate/government hybrid is the one that get's printed. My experience flying is not one where the public is well respected. Who knows what happened? He could have been a jerk or he could have been provoked. Just because you had a beer does not mean you should be disrespected. Certainly the iron fist was brought out and he is suffering and will suffer more for his behavior. I would like to hear his side in all fairness. I think that is how a free country works. That was not printed in the media..
Hopefully he'll meet his grave before someone else is damaged by him.
"Historical perspective on federal intervention on Quebec legislation:

Challenging Quebec's language laws was left to individual anglophone Quebeckers (and many did.)  The most significant case on the sign laws is Ford v. AG of Quebec [SCC, 1988]. 

In the 1984 trial in Quebec Superior Court the parties were on their own - one individual (Valerie Ford) and a few companies versus the AG Quebec.  The federal government intervened on behalf of the individual and companies at the Court of Appeal. When it got to the Supreme Court, the governments of Ontario and New Brunswick joined Canada as intervenors."

"Bernie is only talking about Ted Cruz when he said, ""Republicans nationally, he (Bernie) said, want to cut Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, completely eliminate campaign finance limits, and deny womens access to abortions.""  Trump won't do that.

The city wants more money (silent rail-crossings, city hall, Urban Renewal District projects, etc.), the county wants more money, the state wants more money (Clean Fuels Bill, new transportation package, etc.) , now we have a candidate that wants the taxpayer to fund all healthcare and college.

"So then, Marco Rubio is among other things a tool for the embittered Cuban hidalgos, who cling to the forlorn hope that their peonage run estates will return to them. Rubio doesn't represent the aspirations of 2/3rds to 7/8ths of Cuban Americans.

Cuba has been dirt-poor for decades. The Cuban people will have to be careful not to sell their birthright out to billionaire developers of upscale resorts (several come to mind, such as Sheldon Adelson, Trump's campaign financer, as well as the Trump family itself), or Cuba will find itself in a pre-Castro situation with a few ultra-rich Batistas owning and controlling the island, and thugs controlling law and politics."
The Broncos lost today because they focused on politics rather than their jobs. I want to watch football not politics.  I didn't watch the game today and I am done with my beloved Broncos because of this behavior.  Do not blame President Trump for their behavior.  They chose to disrespect their country.

Lets say an employer has a rule that says 'no cussing on the job', yet that same employer cusses regularly as do all of his family members that work there.    If a worker is then fired for cussing, the fired employee will win their unemployment hearing.  The rule is null.

It has been common knowledge on both sides of the boarder that documentation requirements were ignore, and people who entered the country (say a visa for an Australian computer geek),often stay in the country past their Visa expiration - the problem being is that we have no way, no resources, to track down millions.

It's an American failure."

It is well past time for a world wide tourism boycott of the USA.  Trump was voted in by the citizens of the USA.  That means Trump is their chosen representative.  Republicans hold both the Congress and the Senate so don't try to tell me that Trump because he did not win the popular vote he is not the choice of USA citizens.  Citizens of the USA have the right to choose a a vagina grabbing President but must accept the consequence that foreign tourists find that choice to be repulsive.

"To characterize Taylor's words as ""trash talking"" is ridiculous. To say she was expecting Trump supporters ""to be quiet"" is also ridiculous - she wasn't expecting them to be quiet, she was only expecting them not to threaten her life. As for saying ""she started it"", she started a civil discourse, while they started the uncivil one. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using the words racist, sexist, megalomaniac in civil discourse. Or to describe Trump for that matter."

"Canada has some of the most lenient rules for protecting passenger rights in the world, i.e. much, much less than the EU and the US. 

This Bill will even further reduce the burden on airlines. After this Bill passes, for example, you would actually have to experience a problem first hand, before you can make a complaint. If you see or hear something you don't like, you can't complain. People who see issues, or problems that need fixing, would not be able to complain. Can you imagine if human rights legislation was written like this.
The purpose is to silence advocates who battle for passenger rights.

The sad part is the Government is parading around as if it is actually doing something for passengers."
"I don't have to repudiate my faith to reject the Da'esh.  They don't represent a majority among my Sunni brethren, and they don't represent we Shi'a at all.  That's why they want to kill us.  Doesn't require me to be delusional to conclude the Da'esh ain't Muslim.  All it requires is an understanding of the fundamentals of the faith--which you clearly do not have and therefore aren't qualified to 'inform' me about my faith--as well as a modicum of common sense and self-preservation.  Da'esh want to kill all Shi'a Muslims.  I and my family are Shi'a Muslim.  It's therefore not a logical stretch for me to hate them.  It is, however, a logical stretch on your part to 'lump' me with them.  But then, bigotry is seldom logical."
Mueller. Quietly working away at Trump's lies.
Juan Valdez are you stupid?  do you have any idea how the media is operated in real communist countries?  Please review the fact that ALL the news media in Russia is controlled by Putin.  Do you have any idea how the Chinese operate their media.  I can tell you that China and Russia do not report anything that is not approved by their leaders.   So what you are suggesting that you have no problem if Trump could approve all the news release?  We know one thing all ready Trump does lie a lot and he for some reason thinks people don't see through the lies.  Listening to his spokesmen try to rationalize his recent lies on the size of the the inauguration is funny but sad.

"Klastri, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.  If the constitution is clear about this matter and there is nothing to decide, please explain why it was necessary to insert the clause and subject to the jurisdiction thereof?   What does it mean?  Liberals have routinely interpreted the 14th Amendment to mean anyone born in the U.S. is automatically a citizen, period.  The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the question of whether the children of illegal immigrants are eligible for birthright citizenship, but you, Klastri, say they are.  We will see when Trump follows up on his promise to stop this nonsense."

"Maybe you can give me a history lesson. Certainly they weren't angels and, as is the case of Jefferson, some probably didn't go out of their way to promote abolishment of slavery. But am I imagining things when I say that they put in place a system of governance and rule of law for freedom and equality that ultimately led to abolition of slavery? Isn't that what we are celebrating with memorials of them? What are we celebrating with a memorial of Lee? Killing blacks and fellow whites to sustain slavery and white rule? Don't you think there's some difference there? Now if we follow your train of thought, why are there so many memorials and monuments to Christian faith? Isn't that religion responsible for more horrendous deaths and horrific acts than any other?"
No an income tax means you actually have to pay for that which you receive.

I hope that's a fact, but when I see some of the younger/newer clergy, replete in cassock, cape an biretta, prancing around church and school grounds*, I wonder what they've been taught, what they believe and what they're teaching. Church teaching on these things has not changed; the unhealthy theology that drives ""unhealthy, perverse, scrupulosity-driven, guilt-inducing lecture(s)"" like the ones you and I remember still props up the teaching.

The ""economy"" can never be a justification.  Is slavery OK because it contributes to a successful economy?  No.  Citing performance of the ""economy"" truly is becoming a racist tactic, in and of itself, to the extent it is aimed at enabling a clear racist in Trump.

""Draining the Swamp""?  For what?  to make it easier to pursue and promulgate racist laws and policies?  Same analysis.  Chirping that slogan is nothing more than a racist tactic.

For those out there who are merely inscipidly ignorant, understand that when you try to justify or support Trump,  You are endeavoring to support the pursuit of racism.

Part of the problem here is shareholders. Every major company answers first to its shareholders, second to its customers and its employees come in a distant third. If a company has a poor quarter, they don't cut stock value or increase prices. They cut wages or lay off staff.

Protesting is patriotic. A lot of watershed moments in our history have stemmed from peaceful protests such as the Civil Rights Act and Womens Suffrage. Conservatives have twisted a Patriot as to only being someone who serves/ served in the military. MLK was a Patriot. Susan B Anthony was a Patriot. Teachers are Patriots. Dissidents are Patriots. If we quell protest in the name of being Patriots we are no better than tyrants.

"OK, as a former teacher for 40 years, I don't like to get into education arguments here because most of the people commenting do not know the real picture and probably never spent a day in a public school classroom as an adult.  But, the quick and easy response to your question about why private schools are so much better is really simple.  Private schools test students in order to ""qualify"" to get in.  If you do not pass the test, you go to public school.  Some even have interview processes (Kamehameha and probably others) and, if you misbehave or somehow do not meet up to their standards, you get ""released"" and go to public school.  If public schools could do the same, believe me, test scores and achievements would skyrocket!  Money does play a role, too.  If I'm a parent paying $20,000, I'll make d*** sure that MY child is keeping up with his studies.  But when there is no tuition to pay, public school, for some, is merely a baby-sitting service."

And, I don't post here to try to convince anyone of anything. I just express my unvarnished opinions.

Certainly, you have the same attitude, judging from the ""bite"" in most of your comments. (Which you're perfectly entitled to express.)

"If this were Germany, would you also be a holocaust denier? As the role of the Soviets in the run up to the election compounds, and the evidence is documented and corroborated... a demagogues only option is to keep stirring the myth he is inventing of himself. Victory tour? a demagogue feeds on applause. Notice how he has humiliated publicly each of this Republican opponents. Naming Rick Perry to Secretary of Energy and every report replays his ignorance and incompetence - while Perry preens with pride! A demagogue uses humiliation to vanquish -- render incapable of recovery. Such it is for the methods of a demagogue. The seven deadly sins... a tool box."

"Is Perez just another incompetent politician or just a fool? 

The late Willie Sutton was once asked why he robbed banks. His famous reply was ""Because that's where the money is!""  

My work has taken me all over the United States. The country is slightly right of center politically. If the Democratic Party wants to win elections, that's where the votes are. 

Has defeat taught the Democrats nothing?
Perez's remarks were foolish, ill considered  and boorish."

Alaska is FALLING people...a once great state that used to have people running her that had some respect and clout. Keeping us running like a fine tuned machine.

"""I'm not a straight man or a heterosexual man""; does that mean you're a gay man or a homosexual man? If you are a straight, you are telling people so every time you talk about women. In the past, gay men had to pretend to be straight by talking about women in the same way."
"The only people looking foolish are the Liberals.  Their rhetoric doesn't match their actions.  
1) Trudeau goes after business owners for using the tax rules to sprinkle income across their families to legally lower their taxes yet doesn't apply the same rules to family trusts of which both Trudeau and Morneau benefit.  Clearly an attack on those who earned their income and against those who inherited their wealth. 
2) Trudeau talks fairness and then goes after the minimum wage earner who may be entitled to a free meal or discount on good purchased from their employer.
3) Trudeau, having been stymied in attacking small businesses owners and minimum wage earners then goes after those with diabetes by eliminating one their tax credits for needed medical supplies.
4) Morneau promised to put his wealth into a blind trust but didn't do so.  Then he proposed policies that would benefit the company he owns millions of shares in.

So, who is looking foolish?"

Sheldon is the dean of the Hull York Medical School in the United Kingdom who led the advisory board that conducted a systematic review of water fluoridation in 2000, that came to similar conclusions as the Cochrane review. The lack of good evidence of effectiveness has shocked him. I had assumed because of everything Id heard that water fluoridation reduces cavities but I was completely amazed by the lack of evidence, he says. My prior view was completely reversed.""
Theres really hardly any evidence the practice works, Sheldon adds. And if anything there may be some evidence the other way."

"Michael, I did not know the particulars of this case.  And much as I am concerned about keeping marketplaces free of discrimination, I am also concerned with keeping people free to live by faith.  (Rock's point is important.)   Maybe the lines can be drawn that allows a cake baker to agree to bake a catalogue cake but not to carry toppers of two grooms and to limit decorations, including writing, to something the cake baker does not find offensive.  Which, it seems, is what the cake baker in this case was willing to do but the state still didn't like it.  

We need a balance and I don't know where it will be. The world is growing smaller, there is more mix of people of different backgrounds, languages, religions. My inclination is to keep public spaces (and that includes marketplaces where goods and services are bought and sold) free of discrimination. 

We need to care about both religious freedom and a cohesive society.  Is it possible to have both?"

A few people on this comment section like guestsquared have some personal anger issues they are trying to resolve through this medium which is quite a distraction from the issue of ""deservedness"".  This girl is a survivor not a victim. and the more we view her as a victim, the more victim posture she can stay in throughout her life.  The only person who should look at her as a victim is LH.

I certainly hope that's too high for you as well, but I'm unsure where your Globe and Mail editorial is bashing the Liberal bill.

You argue that PAC spending outside of election periods will become corrupting. Again, where were you sixteen years ago? Where were you when it was Liberal aligned PACs slandering the Premier on a daily basis months and years before the last two elections? You seemed to have no problems with it then.

Plea bargains could not occur if perps were fairly charged because that would mean prosecutors are granting clemency which they are not empowered to do.

If a prosecutor reduces a charge the law is served only if the reduced charge is the correct charge."

"There's a lot you don't get Christopher..... Many of the Partners are not CA's they are not involved with audits... they are expert professionals.... in tax for example, or IT, Business Systems etc.  Also, most of those who were Partners won't have been involved in the Guptas or in SARS. Looking recently at the division between audit and non-audit among the major international practices (yes, I am a retired CA, UK and until retirement SA as well), the split is about 50/50. 

I too would be somewhat hesitant to appoint a non-Accountant as CEO, least of all from HR, but it's the International Practice who appointed her so who knows she will  be an expert in something on the non-audit side.

"A Swiss Army type folding knife has a good chance of ""folding"" in a self-defense situation and cutting the fingers of the user...it could be used in an emergency to slash, but stabbing will fold the blade into one's own hand. Locking-blade folding knives are much better but usually lack the hilt which will prevent the hand from slipping down the handle and onto the blade. Unless one knows where in the attacker's body to slide a blade most folding knives will break. A repellent spray is fine if it can be properly deployed. But if I were a woman I'd also be carrying a small handgun and practice drawing and firing at close range (proximity is what most male attackers seek) because a potential attacker may well also be armed with a projectile weapon...and may be so highly incensed at being sprayed that he/she will shoot with a gun from a distance."

"Interesting. As a Canadian observing American politics, may I comment here in Canada the past Prime Minister Harper did not like press conferences. Journalists can ask awkward questions, even dishonest ones. I remember a press conference when Paul Martin was Prime Minister. There was the sponsorship scandal going on. Martin was a new Prime Minister. The press conference was out of control, with journalists asking all sorts of tough questions.  I do think someone has to be in charge or in control. Governments do have some right to control the agenda. They have an interest in maintaining an image. But, how to do this fairly is the issue. Concerning this latest twist with the Trump administration, I doubt this is serious. The American press is resourceful. Journalists will continue to report and analyse. As a Canadian, I don't pretend to understand American politics. That is the trouble with Trump, sorting out what is drama from what is real."
Canada should do the same.  Of course it won't because in typical hypocritical Canadian fashion;  Canadians love it when foreign criminals launder their loot through the Canadian financial system.

"Since the mid 1970s' leading business schools have been teaching CA's & MBA's that their ONLY responsibility is to generate shareholder profit. Any thoughts of ""social responsibility"" beyond that are, as American economist Milton Friedman wrote in 1970,  ""fundamentally subversive"". This amoral teaching is, I believe, responsible for this type of cynical treatment of ""human resources"", and the more obvious lack of business ethics and integrity demonstrated so clearly in the SA state capture saga. Profit is not a dirty word, far from it, but it must be balanced against a sense of responsibility towards all stakeholders and not just to shareholder wealth and executive incentives.

"My industry gets to use, free, over 500 million cubic feet of gas per day on the North Slope. We also get propane and other valuable gas liquids free. We also got more than $1 billion worth of public money in corporate welfare for gas development within the Cook Inlet basin.
Meanwhile you Alaskans breath the dirtiest air in the United States because your elected leaders are too stupid or corrupt to ensure you Alaskans have affordable natural gas. Industry is fleeing; such as the refinery that pulled out of North Pole. Good thing you paid Flint Hills more than $70 million in corporate welfare in the last two years. That money could have gone to public benefit.
But what can Fairbanks expect when you have Kelly, Bishop, and Coghill to represent you? Junkyards galore and filthy, cancer causing air.
Cook Inlet gas goes for around $8 dollars per thousand cubic feet. On the Henry Hub it goes for less than $3 dollars."

NKorea will blow it anyway as he is seen preparing for another missile into the Pacific.  We will have to see where that ends up.  If Trump stops all trade with China that would be funny actually....no more junk from China building up in my closets.

But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers..(1 Timothy 1:811.)

THAT is the most ridiculous statement I've heard today.  If you really believed that then you would also believe that the retirement contract that the state of Colorado had with its PERA retirees has been miserably broken.  Many years ago PERA retirees made a judgement to retire based on financial planning that included the COLA guaranteed to them by state contract.  The state broke that contract and the PERA retirees have no recourse.  They are screwed and screwed royally.

I also believe we CAN best oppose it without resorting to violence and censorship.  

I'm guessing you remember the infamous battlefield report from the War in Vietnam: ""In order to save the village, we had to destroy it.""   IMO, antifa is on the same quest.  The members will testify to their beliefs in the core values of our nation ""liberty, freedom and equal opportunity.""  Then they will employ tactics of censorship (usually through intimidation) and violence to achieve those goals.  Their tactics are (again IMO) antithetical to their stated goals.  The antifa focus on violence and censorship destroys the ""village"" of American core values.  regards, Gary Crum"

Its really no different than forcing all of society to pretend clinically depressed people are actually happy and any medical professional who suggested it would be laughed straight out of their profession. Id be interested to see National Geographic explain away that bit of logic but on this issue it would seem ignorance is bliss.

Even if DT and the GOP double the standard deduction (from approximately $6400 now) to around $12,000 for individuals, that is useless if they eliminate the $4050 personal exemption. That means the actual allowable amount that we can deduct remains closely the same. If we add the fact that other deductions will be taken from us, leaving only mortgage interest and charity, how do they figure they will come out ahead?

By your odd way of thinking, Siemian, w/a career completion % of 60 is a better QB than John Elway, because HIS was only 56.9%; which means that you're missing literally everything.
By the OLD rating, Siemian ranks 24th in the NFL(still bad).
But by ESPN's QBR, where experts give a QB more credit for reading the defense and making a great 10 yd throw at a crucial time, than a crappy 10 yd throw that a WR catches anyway EARLY in the game, he's ranked 26th.
Pro Football Focus ALSO uses experts, & ALSO judges QB's ACTUAL play, has him ranked 32nd. 
And yes, 32nd in a 32 team league IS horrible."

Facts do count.  According to your Snopes source, from 1999 to 2008, 175 cases from the 9th Circuit were appealed to the Supreme Court.  That was twice as many as any other Circuit Court; the closest being the Sixth Circuit with 70 cases.   The disposition:  reversed, 107 (61.1%); vacated, 33 (18.9%); affirmed, 35 (20 %).  Reversed and vacated: 80%.  It bad enough putting up with alleged lawyer Klastri; we now have to put up with you."

As reported by Roll Call:
""In the hours after President Donald Trump said on an Oct. 17 radio broadcast that he had contactednearly every family that had lost a military service member this year, the White House was hustling to learn from the Pentagon the identities and contact information for those families, according to an internal Defense Department email.
""The email exchange, which has not been previously reported, shows that senior White House aides were aware on the day the president made the statement that it was not accurate  but that they should try to make it accurate as soon as possible, given the gathering controversy. Not only had the president not contacted virtually all the families of military personnel killed this year, the White House did not even have an up-to-date list of those who had been killed."""
"It is now official.  We have imbeciles who run our government.  Federal efforts against sanctuary cities are for ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.  If you are here LEGALLY, then that is fine.

NO.  NO THEY DO NOT.  Only citizens of our country have rights under our constitution.  The Constitution starts off, ""We the People of the United States..."", not ""We the People of the United States and other foreign citizens who are here illegally..."".  This is truly absurd.

We need to end the free money give away program called the PFD  ,  so thousands will return to the places they came from. If that doesn't happen , crime will continue to increase in our area.   Look at all the names and faces of who's committing the most crime , and it's 100 percent clear diversity is destroying Anchorage. Thousands didn't move from warm climates because they like long dark cold winters and short , often rainy summers.  They moved here for the PFD . Ending it will cause thousands to leave . Crime will drop big time . As will over crowding in our schools , in our prisons , on our roadways and fishing banks . Reject diversity , don't encourage it ."

"The best thing Canada can do for its high tech industries is to vote out the likes of Junior, Wynne and Notley..  They are doing more to hurt the high tech and manufacturing industries that help it. They have imposed higher taxes on Canada's highest income earners.  Paying over 50% of your income on taxes is insane.   That effects skilled high tech entrepreneurs, managers, engineer, IT programmers, etc.  Already, the U.S. taxation is far lower for well-paid high tech staff.  More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.    Combine that with carbon taxes and high energy bills.  .  That also badly effects manufacturing. Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are running huge deficits with no end in sight.  There is no end in sight with their stupidity."
Mr. Traini wants to impose his values and morals on everyone else by raising taxes on things he doesn't approve of. He uses the rationale that everyone needs to pay even more because some people abuse those things. Perhaps we should also start taxing churches because some priests and clergy are pedophiles.
And there are times when the idiocy of Trump is a good thing.

Some Jews are hostile to Xmas because they see Jesus as a renegade Jew, or nonexistent, or his followers as heretic Jews, etc., and the source of all their troubles for the last 2000 years.

This is about ""authenticity"". It's clear that Joseph Boyden has lied about his ancestry. There are journalists who have lied about the authenticity of their subject matter when what they were writing was fiction and not fact. (Think Janet Cooke, Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass, and Jonah Lehrer.)

Joseph Boyden can resolve this quickly by simply publishing his family tree. Who were his parents and grandparents and greatgrandparents? Where did they come from? What First Nation does he come from?

This run most certainly wasn't his first run at the crown and he has made sure to always be in the limelight whether in campaign mode or not. Hells bells he spent five years bellowing about the tremendous evidence his investigators had turned up in Hawaii that proved President Obama was not a legitimate president. He was lying of course like he does so routinely that his followers have to keep moving forward under a cloud of fake/right wing news in order to deflect attention from that steady stream of lies and insults. The fact that all the women came forward with their descriptions of how trump had sexually assaulted them in the last couple of months coincided with his own descriptions of how he felt he had the right to barge into the dressing room of naked teenaged girls because he ""owned"" the pageant.

There's lots of angles to attack this one, but one example will suffice: marijuana legalization.  

The LPC 'legalized marijuana' by downloading the responsibility for enforcement, policy and standards to the provinces, but nonsensically retained federal criminal legislation for sale to minors, introducing a guaranteed conflict between the provincial right to set age of majority and federal enforcement of that law.  Are we really going to get into the business of arresting people and putting them in FEDERAL prison for selling to an 18 year old in Ontario, when that 18 year old can cross over into Quebec and buy it perfectly legally?  It's what already happens with alcohol, but we're talking fines at the provincial level for alcohol, not felony convictions like we would with pot.

"Actually, I don't think ALL libertarian ideas are wacky, e.g. legalizing at least marijuana, if not other ""hard"" drugs, noting most were completely legal--and even available through the Sears catelog--in 19th century America, when many town sheriffs were also legally authorized to confiscate all hand guns within city limits until their owners left town:)

I also saw a libertarian economist endorse Bernie Sanders as the most ""libertarian"" candidate running for president in 2016, on John Stossel's FOX News program earlier this year--Gary Johnson not withstanding:)

"Hi William, I have an interesting observation. You have judged me as of the devil on a non essential (WO) and made it a salvational issue. The other thing you have judged me on is testing your doctrine by scripture. Which you call blasphemy. I know that you might have been heated up in the moment but you must think how silly it is to make WO and and taking your writings as cannon as the test of faith. You should save that kind of rebuke for those that deviate from essential issues like the nature of Christ or the Trinity and the like. And as fare as my church, we don't drive people away as a matter of fact our church seats about 800 and we have to have three services to handle all our members. We have had over 100 baptisms this year and our worship team is awesome, all young people. We have coffee in church if we wont and snacks. In other words are church is hospitable and kind. By the way the paster doesn't call anyone of the devil if they think different on non essentials.

"Scott, very informative article.

It shows the difficulty in futures trading.  You need to get both the direction and the timing correct.  It looks to me that if the price is currently being driven by the futures market as you indicate, than this means that we should eventually see the price of oil increase to reflect supply/demand balance.  The investment in production has been much lower the past 2 years as the price of oil has been declining.  Eventually this will have a large impact on world production and with demand on a steady but slow upward climb, inventories will drop.  I see US shale being able to fill some of this void with fairly quick turnaround, but it won't be able to make up all production that is being lost, especially in those long time frame and expensive deep water wells.

This seems to me like a good opportunity to pick up some solid low cost, well financed producers that have seen stock prices driven down due to concern about the recent drop in oil prices."

"""...21% of the children [of India] experience 'severe sexual abuse' before the age of 18.""

Actually, it is worse than that. According to Renuka Chowdhury, Women and Child Development Minister six years go, more than half the children in India are subjected to sexual abuse, but most do not report it. Parents and relatives were mostly found to be the perpetrators of child abuse, too. And only in the last ten years has the government started to bar (against parents' wishes) the employment of children under age 14 as domestic servants or in hotels, restaurants or small tea shops because they are often subjected to sexual abuse, violence and mental trauma. Given this reality, one would think bishops would be all the more proactive in keeping the church safe from such savage and pitiless exploitation of children."

It is a dishonest system where consultant driven messaging that employs behavioral science and focus groups to generate messages/talking-points that move the voters.  It is rarely the politician's core beliefs that are examined; but instead, the consultant driven messaging.  Whereas Trump is a despicable human and is not a candidate that a conservative would want nor is he the candidate that the majority of Alaskan Republicans voted for (note that the most Republicans are not conservative but instead progressives) so it appears that you are throwing out ""Red Herrings.""

"The forest industry uses forest health as a front to vindicate increased logging in our federal forests. It tells us our lush federal forests, still filled with old trees, are sick and need more logging to become healthy again. How, one wonders, did the worlds greatest and richest forests persist for eons in Oregon without the timber industry here to log them into health?
    
Industry spends millions funding pseudo-scientific institutes, lobbyists, politicians and even a few environmentalists to sell its sick federal forest message to the public. No wonder: The profits to be made from logging our undervalued mature timber are huge!

This is because the federal forests still have remnant stands of scarce and immensely valuable old trees  trees that industry stripped out of its forests long ago. Its also because logging old trees out of our forests is kept unfairly profitable for the timber industry through a century of carefully guarded timber appraisal and sale subsidies."

It is also my opinion that Trump treated the Khan father and mother with condescension and contempt, and when the Khans spoke up about it, Trump went into a furious days-long tweet storm of aggrieved sulking. Why didn't he simply express, at the earliest opportunity, his sympathy for their son's ultimate sacrifice for his country? As EJ Dionne quotes Groucho Marx today,  Sincerity is the key to success.

What if your home was getting burned down in Furguson or the mayor of Baltimore told the police to stand down and let people blow off steam and burn down your house or business you took a lifetime to build ? Had any of those people had just one assault rifle , the thugs would have passed right on by and victimized the person without the means to protect themselves.  I doubt compassionate pleas to not burn or steal your property would have been considered.  The mere sight of the gun would have been enough to protect your family and property . And if the mere sight wasn't  deterrent enough , the first clip would have been . We live in dangerous times . Flower power is dead."

"It's also worth noting that statues of Lee, Stonewall, and other Confederates did not go up right after the Civil War for the purpose of venerating the men themselves. The statues were erected decades later, many after 1900, by Southerners then codifying Jim Crow. For Trump to equate these with statues of Washington and Jefferson, to lump them all together as ""history"", is profoundly stupid on his part."

Drug dealing is still illegal and dealt with harshly.  Other EU countries tried to emulate the program.  With the 2008 recession, their budgets were slashed for the addicts in program and caused overdoses, increased crime, and increased disease transmission, increased homelessness.  Can you see us having an Injections Site AND wrap-around services?  I don't believe there will be funding for both.  Why not use any proposed funding and increase needed detox/rehab facilities and sober living environments along with all the needed physical/mental health and social services.  The way I see it, Injections Sites are prolonging the suffering and misery of the addict with the usual end result of death.  Which would be more compassionate?"

The biggest problems I saw at the agency were frequent disrespect for the performance and ability of those who were capable of doing a good job, workloads driven by chronic failures to provide mandated ""active efforts,"" huge turnover both created by impossible workloads and persistently poor recruiting and supervision, and a cultural milieu that treated responsible Native organizations as adversaries, instead recognition of them as indispensable partners. All the time I worked in the Northern Region, the only professional and competent director I ever saw was Rod Caskey, run out early by the Hickel administration which appointed a host of losers. The only supervisors I saw with a whit of common sense were long-retired Linden Staciokas and Tim Stewart."

"Ok, here is an example of a biased, establishmentarian media, so biased it lost its sense of presenting ""facts"". During the Brexit campaign the Globe and Mail published a long series of editorials and op-ed pieces, every single one of them opposing Brexit.  Nowhere in these tedious writings was there any coherent discussion of the gains and losses of Brexit. Nowhere was a discussion of how the EU is organized, how the European Bank works, and so forth. It is accepted that intellectual enrichment improves through exposure to differing points of view. But with the Globe we do not have that anymore (the fine Rob section excepted).

My question isn't how the GOP will cope with their insane narcissistic leader. My worry is how many people will die before Trump is removed from office!

"I quite agree.  ""Reform"" can have several meanings, depending on context.  But the word ""erform"", when used in the context of the Catholic Church, conjures up one ""reform"" that went terribly awry, and so the word is loaded with baggage.

Unfortunately, that's not how the word is usually understood when talking about reforming the Church."

"Hey: listen up, Koncerned. Has it ever occurred to you that we live in a gun-profligate and overly-violent society here in the USA? No? Has it ever occurred to you these mass shootings, random ones at that, are virtually an every day occurrence, anywhere, anytime in this country? ""You are now free to move about the country"", right? 
Youthful ""foolishness"" is also responsible for most casualties by firearm in this country AND most other places. It's called raging hormones + alienation + not much hope for a decent future + instant gratification/indemnification by violence against others with a firearm. Spurned by a lover? ""I'll show her!"" Some guy cuts you off in traffic? ""Road-rage!"" Those school bullies? ""I'll show them!"" That politician? Again, whether defined as 'terror' or not, it is violence by any other name. Every.Damned.Day.In.This.Country. 
 An insult is a form of violence too. Think about it. What are the odds there will NOT be an Anchorage homicide today? Now go figure..."
I have never done that.  Where is your proof?
"Populist discontent has been brewing for a long time.  And while media coverage is  skewed toward right wing discontent with the status quo, they seem to have forgotten the Occupy movement in 2011.  Occupy was a failure, but it's a pretty safe bet that those same people are the ones protesting Trump.

Even centrists are becoming increasingly disgusted with the hypocrisy and privilege they see in the 1%.  But that 1% has done an astounding job of convincing disillusioned voters that the problem is not with their unfettered greed -- it's immigrants taking their jobs and globalization.  They have also managed to pit worker against worker -- not that long ago, if a worker saw another with better wages or benefits, s/he would say ""How can I get that?""  Now the response is  ""I don't have that -- why should you?""

The same people who have decimated opportunity by lining their own pockets are now promoting themselves as saviours. Trump and O'Leary are the worst kind of hypocrites."
"NRA - check.  Remember back in 1967?
""The National Rifle Association, which in 1967 supported the repeal of California's open-carry law when members of the Black Panther Party began carrying legally purchased firearms, said gun control ""will do nothing"" to stop gun violence, and then urged Congress to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines; and at least 64 members of Congress who've accepted campaign contributions from the NRA announced that they would pray for the victims in Las Vegas, including a representative who said gun control was ""not the answer"" and who once spoke at an international white-supremacist conference, authored a bill banning gay marriage in Louisiana, and was, after being shot by a 66-year-old white man, defended by a black female police officer who is married to a woman, a demographic in the United States that is a hundred times more likely to be shot and killed by a man than to use a gun for self-defense."" [ Joe Kloc, Harper's]"
"So what, you won't be happy until blacks ""catch up"" from a century ago by committing murder of whites now???

This isn't a sport where there are make-up calls by the refs.  Violence and murder today are wrong no matter what one's skin color is, and no matter what happened a century ago."
"He is most definitely smarter than people give him credit for but the man is also totally amoral, he does not play by the social norms, most of us adhere to, so it is very difficult to beat him at his game, unless you sink to his level and who wants to do that? Ultimately his employment of so many village idiots will be his undoing."
"Do you believe that Bush, Cheney, et al should have been tried and convicted of war crimes? Seeing many of your  comments, it is obvious you do believe they should have been tried for war crimes, just like a good many on the left do. If we are in the preposterous arena, then we are in the same arena that you folks are.  In your case though, there is nothing, no law that has been violated. In our case, there is more than one statute that specifically states that intent is not a determining factor with regard to misuse of classified material. If you know anything about the statutes regarding classified material, you would read Comeys statements and realize that there are at least two clear violations of law that the FBI uncovered. That the FBI would surmise that nothing would be prosecutable is laughable at best. At the very least it shows that a woman who is supposed to be the smartest candidate ever is ignorant of proper protection of classified material or has issues with senility."
"This is laughable, we deal with models  which shows  the earth is warming. Show me a model which shows otherwise. This is just  like your man Trump ."
Accurate? It's incredibly stupid and juvenile.
"Sometimes people are not the right fit for a role, for a supervisor, or an organization. 

The reasons for the termination would be important. Breach of trust or a serious ethical violation can haunt a person for the rest of their career.

Other reasons such as ""non-performance"", ""not the right fit"", ""insubordinate"", having an established work history, the manager should rely on their own experience to determine whether this is true.

Such an assessment could be environmental rather than intrinsic to the employee, and having changed the environment, role, organizational culture, or manager the employee performs differently."

Trump is an intellectual cretin.  He abhors logic and facts.  He is a salesman/conman who uses bluster to make a sale.  I seriously doubt he would profit from a meeting with Pope Francis or any scientist.
"If that were true, EVERY team would lose, dog-brain!"
Somebody has to say it. Did you fall off the idiot train again?
"Well, same old, gong show in their own zone under Wilson, under Carlyle, and now under His Niblets.  Who knows, maybe even the lapdog Toronto hockey media will eventually get after Babcock like they did in running the other 2 out of town....

Your Leafs score a lot, as will often be the case with players who really just want to show off, freewheel, and worry 'bout playing defence another day.  Maybe if they go that way full bore, we'll see...

If everything goes their way, as it did last season, then they make the playoffs.

The breaks usually even out over time, so things may not work for Your Leafs way like they have prior.  Marner and Bozak to name 2, not looking good, Marner especially now looks like a boy playing against men.  Gardiner another 1.

Yeah, Andersen will have his moments, but overall, he not gonna do you any favours."
"Two comments on this?? When an article relating to climate change goes up, dozens of posters claiming the oil sands are the lifeblood of Canada's present and future economy immediately pop up to attack science they don't understand. Yet when an article on the toll taken fighting the Fort McMurray fire is published... crickets."
"Jack, he has a track record of inexperience with economic principles, and business terms like ""fungible.""  I am, however, stealing your post and using it any time someone like them doesn't understand how simply saying ""Federal funds never touch abortion!"" is the most ignorant of comments."
"Bernier would be a poor choice.

Even a Conservative supporter like me is not comfortable with him, for all the reasons outlined in this article.

Furthermore, his Conservative supporters in Quebec (and perhaps outside of Quebec) represent the boys in short pants who I had hoped were gone with Harper."
"Actually that isn't the case:

 ""Solvency deficiency

"""Some members of the solar industry are pointing to home energy systems, equipped with batteries and solar, as a possible solution to help neighborhoods recover after hurricanes.""

lol, fragile photovoltaic panels would be among the first casualties of not just hurricanes but any sustained high wind event. And biofuels would suffer the same distribution disruptions as any conventional fuel, such as impassable roads. That's if the feed crops and their processing plants were not destroyed."
"Doonesbury was excellent. 

And illustrates the folly of psychological labels by the political partisans (anti-Trumps, in this case) whether they have the requisite training or not.

An ad hominem attack remains an ad hominem attack whether the label is from a Democratic psychologist or just a Democratic psychophant [sic]."
"Oregon is nothing like Illinois--although it gets closer every time the Republicans block revenue reform and postpone addressing structural deficits. Revenue reform is in part raising taxes and in part modernizing and stabilizing our revenue system. Oregon has both revenue problems and spending problems--and neither is a single problem. 

If the Republicans are dreaming of success in the next election, then they are not being realistic. If they are playing chicken with the Democrats to see who will do the most damage to Oregon before giving in and being forced to take draconian measures, then that is just evil--and will make us more like Illinois.

We need some centrist politics from both sides. We need more give and take. The Republicans are the minority party, but they can stop the machinery on revenue reform, which they did. And that's extreme and destructive--and a waste of political power."
Gardner is a classic example of the GOP herd of Trump sycophants who can't curry their hero's favor fast enough or often enough. What a pathetic group of spineless boot licks.
"We would leave his daughter out of it if Trump would stop talking about how he would like to date her.

He also said it was okay for Howard Stern to call her a piece of ass. 

These are things Trump said. Time for him to show some personal responsibility and live up to the words that came out of his mouth."
Perhaps we can persuade nasa to send trump to mars as an experiment of the effects of space travel upon mental illness.
"I describe a generic garment and you claim that it fits you?  

 Since I haven't mentioned you and slander requires a knowing falsehood, I reject your assertion.  Hyperbole wins no points.

 Sanger's biases and own writings support every fact I have asserted about her.  ""The Negro Project"" is perhaps her best known solution to the problem of poor Negro women.  Planned Parenthood apologists have been struggling with that one for decades.

 If you can't accept historical facts which cast your heroine in a less than favorable light, that is your intellectual loss or handicap."
"Blaming algae? Algae is blameless.  The organisms are just responding to the conditions present.  Right now the warming temperatures are supporting the increased proliferation and growth.  As for idiocy,  what would you call failure to accept scientific consensus and overwhelming evidence?"
"So long Europe. So many people are afraid of being called a name, that they would rather be killed in Islamic Extremist Terrorist Attacks. That's what they are and there is no way around it. The BBC now says that they just have to get used to it. Really? How about removing the individuals from your nation that cause terrorism. It's been awhile since the last Buddhist blew themselves up or maybe the elusive explosive Hindu. The fact is, the Muslim belief system desperately needs a reformation. Within that, it needs to say not to  kill, steal, rape, etc. Why the Left wants to align themselves with those who throw homosexuals off roofs, don't allow women to drive, and stone women to death for being raped is beyond me. Also, why is it when you point out Muslim terrorism, you're called a racist? Islam is not a race, it's a religion... Don't forget to Spay or Neuter a Leftist - Bob Barker."

"North Korea, India, Pakistan, and Israel are not part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)."
"Is Mr Mason not aware of the fact that the world is currently sitting on a glut of oil more than large enough to meet our dwindling needs for the stuff as alternative forms of energy become more and more available? Is he also not aware that the current product coming down the existing K-M pipeline is going (not to China) to California? If we don't need the world's dirtiest oil - and we don't - why doesn't Ms Fonda (after the ad hominem attacks) and all the others have a point? The science is clear: The oil is dirty and hard to refine and Canada, on a per capita basis, is already one of the world's largest producers of C02 ....those are all equally valid 'truths' Mr Mason. Your personal and, frankly, childish attitude makes me wonder if it's you who's past your 'best before date'."
"Attention Oregonians:  Senator Ron Wyden,  a UofO law school grad,  failed the Oregon bar exam three times,  and has never been able to practice before the bar.  So when he pontificates  (or would that be rabbinicalates?)  that Trump Jr. talked to the Russian lawyer soliciting buyers for information she evidently did not have,  he was NOT colluding with anyone about anything.  A shill in a skirt did a fan dance with some legal papers,  conned her way to an interview,  was listened to until it was determined that she was barking up the wrong tree about the wrong stuff, and was politely excused.  

Now,  was there dirt on Hillary Clinton?  Who would know?  Would dirt be useful in a political campaign?  You betcha!   Would the DNC solicit dirt on any Republican candidate?  Damned straight they would!!  Is that all ""politics as usual?""  yep.  The American Way.   Happens daily.  The DNC is dredging for damaging information on any sitting Republican today, yesterday, and will be tomorrow."
"Wow!  The over-the-top, melodramatic rhetoric spouted by pence sounds more like the ridiculous garbage we typically hear from tin-pot dictators trying to sound tough than the calm our leaders should be conveying.  It also doesn't seem wise to threaten a crazy person.  Of course, that goes both ways, as we don't know how either trump or kim will respond.  Both have shown themselves to be impulsive and vindictive."
"Geez, I'd have thought the bill would have passed the test there. Oh! i gotta it, the cashier took the Real McCoy and inserted the Fake bill for payment. Gotta hand it to them on the WestSide"

"We are the biggest small town in 'America'........and with that all the limitations that one can imagine.  I have to say that Gary Kubota practiced tremendous restraint and is to be commended for that in his coverage of the Kosi issue.  Maybe with more details there will be a more clear picture coming, or maybe the story will not get the focus.  It is after all a story that touches the golden egg of tourism (airport), and 'we' don't go there very often as a community."
"John, did you somehow miss the link to the 70 page PowerPoint that lays bare the lies about SB-21, and how it is costing Alaskans billions of dollars per year?

Following the Alaska Constitution (Article VIII) and not giving away billions of dollars of our oil per year IS a credible solution, John.  

You think the corrupt bastards are going to stop giving away our oil once they have gotten their hands on our dividends and have imposed a income tax?

Have a cup of coffee, read Dr. Robin Brena's presentation, and tell us if Robin made even one mistake.  (He didn't)."

"I hope there's a video recording posted of the April 12 Ward 1 candidates' forum that the JWN and LWV sponsored.
 
Chris Wig was hilarious. I felt I was watching a Saturday Night Live actor impersonate a pompous local politician in a two-bit town.
 
The ""punch line"" came when Wig gave his closing statement as a discourse on what it mean to be ""progressive,"" puffing up his final act with references to the Knights of Labor fights with the Pinkerton goons.

Wig wrote an idiotic, insulting and inflammatory letter to Council after the 5-3 vote in favor of a motion by Councilor Clark to protect the R-1, single-family neighborhoods. He's no friend of neighborhoods.

Wig is more interested in seeing himself as a heroic savior of the unwashed than listening to his ward constituents' concerns.
 
If you know the following references, you'll understand: Wig as our city councilor would be the worst ""marriage"" of Kevin Hornbuckle and Andrea Ortiz.

BTW, the Republican bill states that if a person has insurance, and lets the insurance lapse, s/he must pick up new insurance or re-new their old policy within 60 days, or s/he to wait six months for full coverage to take effect when s/he gets new insurance. I assume s/he's still on the hook for premiums. The Republicans are saying this is to ""encourage"" young people to stay insured.
So, what's the difference between government encouragement and a government mandate?"
"The sad reality is, the RCMP is rapidly emerging as one of the most corrupt national police forces on earth on top of the sexual harassment and bullying. 

Up until 2 months ago, right about the time they got caught in their dirty little secret, they were using these devices illegally."

All the illegal ways  to get rid of PERS have already been tried.  The only 'address' for PERS is local and state governments paying the PERS bills that have been found to be protected under the Oregon and US Constitutional Impairment of Contracts Clause.
We are in uncharted territory with a president so incompetent.  Hillary was not my first choice but she would have been a far better president than the Donald.  We would probably still be friends with Australia and other allies although we might be a bit miffed at Russia.  :-)
"So basically almost all of the ""cuts"" are in oil tax credits ($430 million), which still have to be paid by statute and $663 million from the PFD, which falls on the backs of the citizens...  I mean, I don't know... Seems like all that ""cut"" garbage is puffery.  Can't make substantial cuts anywhere else, develop other resources of revenue and so we hammer our own residents with the biggest penalty.  Don't you love politics."
This Trudeau Government is dangerous.  It cares more about it's relations with China than our national security.
You're technically right but I get upset when the head of the world's most powerful military suggests that the U.S. and Israel will take care of any 'problems' with Iran. Even going so far as threatening to renege on carefully negotiated nuclear non-proliferation agreements.
"Actually a Swastica is a Religious ICON (Get your words straight when debating)  and guess what? THAT will stand up in court, should anyone refuse to make such a cake while making other religious icon ones-like Crosses, and Star of Davids.

The ONLY reason and I must repeat ONLY is because of Black Gold (texas T) and the high price it carried. As soon as that price dropped we saw the real face of Conservative governments in Alberta and it was pathetic. They had no idea of what to do after years and years of holding power. Just pathetic and if anyone is dumb enough to vote for their pathetic lot again gets what they deserve.

One example came in mid-August when campaign chief Paul Manafort went on State of the Union with Jake Tapper told a story about how US troops at the NATO base at Incirlik, Turkey had been repeatedly attacked by terrorists. 


This was part of the campaign message of Obama weakness, which Trump could repair. 

The only problem was that nothing like this had happened. (This was relatively soon after the failed coup in Turkey.) 

So where had Manafort gotten this? 

It turned out that the only other publications which had reported anything remotely like this were RT and Sputnikness. 

Hayes Brown caught this at the time in Buzzfeed.

Are black soldiers the only ones who ""suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?""

He's beginning to feel unloved, like a fish out of water, in Colorado's liberal democracy. He's beginning to feel socially exposed. He's beginning to feel the press and weight of history's eyes upon him and the reputation and summation of his life. Is he on the right side of history? Is he, really?"
"Hockey is a fringe sport. Nobody in the States watch hockey... MLS is already seen as the ""4th"" sport in America. Not hockey....ESPN now regards MLS to be the big 4.... relegating hockey to fringe status.

"Re-certification with a flight instructor every 24 months is a legal requirement to fly. A periodic medical evaluation of the pilot at least once every 24 months is a legal requirement to fly (except for some younger pilots, once every 36 months if they are not involved in commercial operations). An annual inspection on the aircraft every 12 months is a legal requirement to fly. If the aircraft is used ""for hire"" it must also have an inspection after every 100 hours of flight time. There will always be instances of pilot error or mechanical failure, but they are greatly reduced by the training, evaluation and inspection requirements built into the system. Why do you hear about every airplane crash? Because they happen so infrequently."

"lol!!  Trump knows people from all over the world.  Russians are all over NY.  They buy overpriced condos there and mansions in Florida.  Trump dumped a huge over-priced mansion on the richest guy in Russia 2 years ago in Florida.  Trump had the Miss Universe in Russia a few years ago and that opened up the entire world to Russia.  Trump is OK with anybody that is OK with him.  Russia is like China....capitalism is taking over.  In China it has been on-going for 40 years.  It started with Nixon and moved on from there.  We do business with China.  That doesn't mean we are communists. Trump sells apartments in NY to thousands of people over the years.  Rents to them, manages entire buildings.  These ""new wealth"" commies love high end stuff, so of course Trump will be involved with them.  Many of them are Russians, Chinese, Americans, Blacks, Whites, .....you name it.  OMG!!

I mean, couldn't it be said that this sort of ""marketing"" is precisely what the recruiters for the Religion of Peace are hoping for? Who does it help? The victims? The victims' families? Future visitors to an area? Americans? It doesn't change the past, it doesn't change the present, and it doesn't change the future. But it gives the terrorist mills yet another data point/goal to encourage its rookies to strive for. What if they just said something like, ""This is a terrible incident that we continually endeavor to prevent in the future"", and leave it at that? I know it's a minor, and perhaps even silly distinction, but there is meaning to it: don't even give these psychopathic @#%&*ers the explicit validation they seek.

"We can start with the Electoral College. It was created so states with more black slaves than white people have power over states with fewer black slaves and more white people. It is still protecting white supremacy today. Trump would not be president with out it. Another is the 2nd Amendment. This country would not exist without it. You can't build a nation on ethnic cleansing and race based slavery without murder on a massive scale.  The army was too small for fast responses to slave revolts thus the need for ""a well regulated militia"".  White men can walk into a luxury hotel with an arsenal without question yet black folks are killed for mere suspicion of being armed. Then we could add gerrymandering that allows the GOP to dominate Congress with fewer total votes than Democrats. Then there is the practice of racial profiling. It is practiced in many forms in all our institutions to one degree or another. I could go on."

This situation sounds alot like another Oregon government multi million dollar boondoggle...The famous Wapato Jail. In case you forgot the Wapato Jail was built for $58 million but never opened. It has sat vacant since 2004. Add the 100+ million for the JC Boondoggle and add in the 303 million dollars wasted ...and I do mean wasted ...signing up exactly the same number of people incarcerated in the Wapato Jail. Now I hear that Oregon is short 1 billion dollars for its next budget cycle and if anyone had lost their job over the almost 1 billion they have wasted it would be easier to feel bad for those poor poor democrats who control both houses and have a lock on the governors mansion who have finally found a way to run out of other peoples money ... they squander it on multimillion dollar white elephants that we apparently didn't need and for the obamacare; never wanted to start with. Yet you keep voting for Democrats ...how stupid are you people?

"I realise that it's sacrilegious to say anything negative about Anderson but my feeling was that the Sens won this game in spite of the goalie. which I had hoped would be Condon because it seems that Anderson has been lighting tire fires for most of this series, as has been his perpetual habit, starting by letting in early ,easy goals deflating the guys in front of him.  Who lets in two goals in the first 5 minutes of a second round playoff game FFS ?  Now that I've gotten that out of my system, it looked like Neil was having a great time in the penalty box, delighted by what he was seeing from his team mates, like a grandpa watching the young 'uns having fun."
"To provide some analysis / context that isn't provided here: Essentially, the University told the players: ""Listen,  there's been an accusation, you guys are screwed.  You're going to be found guilty. But, when we find you guilty, this will be your 'sentence'. Everything will be kept out of the news, you can transfer to another school, you can move on with your life.""  The players, knowing they were screwed no matter what, took the deal with a sense of optimism. 

You can see this was pretty explicit in UO's attorney's email to the player's attorney's here: 

http://uomatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-08-at-12.45.13-PM-600x673.png

Ultimately, after the news broke about the case, the players (rightfully, I think), said. ""That was a raw deal. We had no choice in the matter. There was no due process. We were negotiating at a disadvantage."" 

However, Judge McShane ultimately found that because the students accepted the plea deal, there was due process."
"That reason ever saw the light of day in Europe occurred mainly because centuries of  oppression from religion and monarchies was defeated. Now radical elements of the worlds most conservative religion, emanating from some of the most backward parts of the world (not sure which is the causative factor there)  have been awarded a foothold to impose a religious identity war on western civilization by the same European liberals who in large part only have the chance to be liberal because the fascist ideologies of religion had been overcome in the first place.

"So your point is that since fines are not leveled at mother nature for allowing sediment into rivers it is legitimate for people and the companies they run to discharge sediment into our rivers. 
I see the comparison except that mother nature isn't making a profit at the expense of wildlife or the common ownership of our waters. But by your logic, since streams dry up, I could take all the water I want. Since volcanoes pollute, I can burn in my backyard even on days when people with breathing difficulties end up in emergency rooms. 
Now of course, mother nature also produces massive die-offs of species. By that logic, our actions which cause extinction are not to be criticized - its like mother nature. In fact, since animals kills each other, war is not to be critiqued. Even our own extinction is just part of the natural order."
This can be a dangerous opportunity for the terrorists to come to this island. We have to be pro-active not re-active regarding this issue about our own homeland security.

If the pro-choice people still have choice, and the pro-life people don't have to pay for someone else's choice that they cannot abide, is that not a middle-ground that can be started from?

I still expect vigorous debates on the issue, of course. But everyone has a little bit of what they wanted."

Both having questionable activities.   Look at the IRS under Obama.  All were politicized.   Are you telling me Obama knew nothing about any of this?   Look at how Russia got boosted in the world under Obama.   Looked at how Obama paid off a terrorist regime.   Look at how Obama lied.  Is that an example of a very decent man?"

- Why is that jerk riding my tail? I'll show him!

Now I'll know it's actually more like:
- No one is riding my tail, so I don't need to get in the right lane until the legislature pays to repave it.
Then:
- Why is that jerk riding my tail? Doesn't he know the legislature hasn't paid to repave that washboard posing as a right lane? Why doesn't he call his state representative and senator and lobby them to repave it? I might as well drive in the ditch as in that right lane because of those idiots in the legislature.

"Wouldn't it be nice if the story you just read where there was a 20% improvement in attendance were really true? It is not!  Dig deeper & one would find the real reason for the vast improvement in attendance at WHS.  Truthfully, Mr. Stone manipulated the attendance system for almost 1/4 of this school year by having office staff mark students who were suspended as excused in the attendance system. This was done by marking them as ""school sponsored activity"" instead of the proper and more accurate ""In School Suspension"". THIS is where the vast majority of the improvement in attendance really came from. If you're wondering why such drastic measures were taken, it's simple really...the feds want fewer minorities suspended (aka- Cut the Education pipeline to Prison). In order to accomplish this goal they have financially incentivized States to make improvements in this area. This outcome was a result of pressure from ASD headquarters for all Principals to be creative & do ""something""!!!"

"I agree. 

It is easy to blame common core or other educational standards that point out deficiencies. Most of these deficiencies come down to a lack of parental involvement and a lack of studying.

And it politically more convenient to use affirmative action than admit that there are some issues that we as a society need to focus on. It some ways, affirmative action has transformed itself into a separate but equal system.

"They've tried kiosk restaurants in the last century.  How'd that work out?  You able to run on down and pick up a burger or a burrito from one these days?  As for prices ballooned by living wages . . . not really.  Australian McDonalds workers earn above that nation's $15 minimum wage.  Australian consumers pay $0.71 more than their American counterparts for their Mickey D's Big Mac (in Australian dollars, they pay less than Americans if you convert to USD).  Australia's unemployment rate is unremarkable compared to the US (maybe lower given how our politicians cook the books on unemployment statistics).  In Denmark, McD's pays $20 an hour (union power), and a Big Mac there will run you a whopping $0.35 more than here in the US.  So, demonstrably, the only argument that we can't pay living wages would be that we Murrikans are just too stupid to figure out ideas that work plenty of other places where, I suppose, the people simply must be smarter.  As Herr Drumpf would put it, ""SAD."""
Yea like we have hundreds of thousands of potential visitors from those nations...What an IDIOT.
"President Trump is challenging the establishment that includes almost all Democrats and many RINOs (the John McCain and Lindsey Graham types)  that are riding the gravy train  peddling political influence to lobbyists and others involved in their back-room funding.  His first order of business once all of his major appointments are confirmed is to instruct his cabinet to purge their departments of the  Obama, Clinton, Lynch, Holder, and Kerry appointees and deputy positions so these people are not in a position to undermine his domestic and foreign policy efforts.  Throw out the trash and drain the swamp.   And let the press belch out their vomit as they will regardless as it is their nature."
"Indeed, her weak agenda has been overlooked due to the Trump Circus. Although Hillary presents herself as the most Presidential, she will NOT bring change and we can't risk more of the same.

Think about it..nothing says your standing up against greed like banding together to demand free stuff. Really??

Entrapment, not help, pure and simple. With Hillary we get more of this goofy crap and a poor economic and foreign policy to boot. I am voting Trump. Do I like him..no I cannot stand him - he will be a hugh embarrassment.

Why would you think inmates will try to kill him, they hate cops! His only detractors will be the correctional officers who will no doubt treat him with disdain and will try to make sure he doesnt get to comfortable. Personally I think he should be publicly executed by firing squad."
Politicians hide out where the public can't Tar and feather them for stealing and wasting our money. I think it's pathetic with 700K People living here we can't seem to live within our means.

There is NO report by anyone who attended the dinner of ANY booing- -except for Trump's nasty and highly inappropriate remarks about HRC.

"Of course we do not require doctors to perform abortions against their will. That has nothing to do with this.

To use your analogy we'd have to be talking about an abortion doctor who refused their services to Hindus. 

This is a civil rights issue. In the same way that you cannot put up a sign in your store that says ""no blacks"" you are not allowed to discriminate based on who someone is. You have every right to discriminate based on what someone does however (no shoes no shirt no service). Because this baker had a business open to the public, but refused his services because they were gay, he violated their civil rights. 

He actually has done the right thing by refusing to offer cakes at all. If he can't stomach the idea that his services would be used by the public, of which some citizens might be gay, then he should not make cakes. Same thing for racist doctors: if you offer right to die services but don't like the idea of serving black people then you shouldn't offer it at all."

But it grew exponentially with the Bill Clinton candidacy in 1992 with billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife and his funding of the Arkansas Project, which with the American Spectator and other right wing rags promoted lie after lie about Bill and Hillary Clinton. It's an industry by this time, pumping out spin and lies night and day. Uranium to Russia, Benghazi, pay to play, all that utter lying nonsense pumped out to the gullible masses by Ailes' Fox News.

And it takes millions of acres of farmland out of food production and has a huge detrimental impact of the commodities market.  The use of more and more pesticides is just a little ""bonus.""

"This article is not factual in that Clinton is the ""best"" candidate for the democrats.  By leading the argument with this I think registerguard  is in ""cahoots"" with Clinton and the establishment.  By the end of the democratic primaries, Bernie will need to have more pledged delegates than Hillary, not impossible, and prove that the polls putting him farther ahead of the GOP candidates are true.  ""best"" is also based on opinion  not facts, ""best"" will be determined by the voters not the media. This article has nothing to base it's argument other than Clinton is currently leading in delegates.  This will change because Sanders is no longer getting his butt kicked in the religious conservative south where Clinton's machine pandered to.  Clinton's pandering is starting to show in the north and west and Bernie suporters are coming out to say ENOUGH is ENOUGH.

In order for an obstruction of justice crime to be committed, there doesn't have to be an investigation against the person who committed the obstruction. Endeavoring to interfere or influence any investigation of anyone (and especially using the power of his office to do so) is obstruction of justice. Now, is there anything about this that you still. don't understand?

Comey, who served multiple Presidents from both parties, a law enforcement professional testifying under oath, can't be trusted?

Assuming that is primarily what he is about in terms of major reform, the only thing he can do is lead the bishops to water and invite them to drink, to speak up, to disagree, etc. That is happening.  

It would be antithetical to this thrust for Francis to fall back on the V1 understanding of the Bishop of Rome, and introduce reform by dictate. I am not at all convinced, for example, that Francis personally believes women cannot be priests. Were he to initiate such a reform (women priests) using his V1 authority, he would continue the subversion of V2 collegiality of St. JP2 and B16. Were he to call a synod on the topic, the conservatives would rule the day, and possibly erect another barrier in the form of one more stupid statement against female ordination.

Then, in the case of Zubik v. Burwell involving similar issues, which consolidated six pending suits by Protestant and Catholic organizations, the Court sent the Government packing when it revealed that it had been able all along, and knew all along,  in supplemental briefs ordered by the Court that its main assertion in the case was a fabrication.

"How about, Stop Giving Trump So Much Free Press Every Time He Says Something Stupid?  The ""press"" is acting like a bunch of simpletons and Trump is cleaning up because of it.

Back in the 60's, populist revolutions were grabbing headlines:  Public action on the part of citizens gained control of a largely free press through direct action, and were able to use the media to disseminate vital information and spread revolutions that affected the way we view the environment, civil rights, and corporate wars---Revolutions that almost upset the balance of power, and made dubious characters like Richard Nixon into flaming liberals out of fear of the populace.

The Powers That Be learned their lesson then, and an increasingly consolidated media has been putting those lessons into effect with establishment-oriented messages and astro-turf movements ever since.  Now it's going the other way with Trump, and our 5th estate has turned into a bunch of drooling idiots."

"Trump is a loose canon; a thoughtless, grandstanding, big-mouthed bully.  His idiotic middle-of the night taunts and posturing are going to have very real consequences, including the  possibility of a nuclear war.  Like ""bring it on,"" ""Shock and Awe"" Bush, he actually thinks this kind of infantile braggadocio is going to scare the equally unstable, narcissistic, bullies in the international community.  How has that worked out for us? Trump needs to be removed from any possible position of power. He has proven time and time again that he is not only temperamentally unfit for the Presidency, but dangerously incompetent, to the point if putting us all in danger."

"People like Sullivan like to focus on the U.S.'s supposed high corporate tax rate.  ""The highest in the world"" they tell us.  While it's true that the nominal 35% corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world, it doesn't give a very accurate picture, because hardly any corporations are actually PAYING the 35% rate.  There are so many loopholes and deductions, that many of our largest corporations effectively pay zero.  A better comparison would be the effective corporate tax rate - the percentage that U.S. corporations actually pay on average.  That number is about 27.7%, which is very close to international norms.  Another informative statistic is corporate tax receipts as a percentage of GDP, which in the U.S. is about 2% (down from about 6 % in 1950)  This is compared to individual  income tax receipts as % of GDP which is about 8%, so clearly it is individual taxpayers, not corporations which are getting hosed.  Sullivan wants to shift more of the burdens to individuals."

Also, you cant very well be an officer of the court but completely disregard the laws that are on the books."

This isn't about bigotry and racism, but thanks for playing those cards.   I don't think I said anything that should be even remotely classified as so.

Similarly, alcohol is poisonous to the body and can harm the liver in getting rid of it. So I would emphasize to them that drinking to get drunk (i.e. for the alcohol) is highly detrimental to health. I'll do my best to make sure they have none of this stuff during the critical years of brain development from age five to puberty. And I would talk to them about addictions. Yes, coffee, but mostly the main one: sugar. Fine at their young age, but increasingly harmful as you grow older. So they will make their own decisions, knowing they will face the consequences."

Worst of all for you, the report states that one of the alleged insurgents threw a grenade but was promptly killed. No mention of Omar killing anybody.  I would imagine that Mrs Speer has a US Army pension from her husband's death for her and her minor children, and that Morris was also taken care of.

Short-term, maybe not so much. My point is that turning over public facilities to charter schools is a slippery slope... in the long term."

"In my opinion, a correction to your post.  Metis were included as being Aboriginal people in the Constitution Act of 1982, however, the term Metis was not defined.  Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada has decided that Metis are indeed ""Indians"" as defined in the Indian Act. However, once again this has not yet been determined what this means, particularly whether or not Metis would then be entitled to the same benefits as other status Indians covered by the Indian Act.

The term Metis (capital M) is applied to those Aboriginals who have a connection to the traditional Metis homelands found in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.  The European part of their ancestry can be traced back to French Canadian and Scottish fur traders.  On the other hand, the use of the term ""metis"" (small m) are Aboriginals who are of mixed European and First Nations ancestry in other parts of the country."

"It's like no one pays attention in civics class anymore.  Presidents are elected by the states. The electors give states a say in the election of the president proportional to the population of the state. The US wasn't designed as a pure democracy and for good reasons. They saw even then that a populous state could override the needs and interests of more sparsely populated states. They built safeguards against this tyranny of the majority via the Electoral College and indirect election of Senators who were supposed to primarily represent state interests while the HOR represented citizen interests. The 17th amendment overrode that, and I personally think that while it solved some issues, it had negative consequences.

"Universities have very high standards for proper speech because one of their goals is to educate students about how to engage in CIVIL debate with those who hold different views.   Threats and insults tend to suppress the free flow of ideas, rather than encourage them.  In order to have a good debate, where everyone feels SAFE to express their ideas, one must discourage the kind of nasty rhetoric that you often hear in an argument in a bar.

"Ah, I see! I agree with your point that sex offender laws wrongfully include offenses that are not sex crimes, such as peeing in the wrong spot. However, I would ask if you agree that the public's unwillingness to restrain from vigilante justice provides grounds that makes the public sex offender list for ALL CLASSES OF SEX OFFENDERS unconstitutional.  I don't think you'd say that just because a child molester moves into a neighborhood a ticked off neighbor has the right to walk over with a baseball bat and beat the offender to death.  Laws that put anyone in danger of life or limb at the hands of hate-fueled vigilantes are unconstitutional on the very grounds the judge ruled.  8th Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment."

"The actual number of crimes doesn't paint an accurate picture, it's the crime rate per capita that tells the true story.  That's why I find these articles amusing, they only focus on the actual number of crimes.  And then they make people such as yourself think the sky is falling.  

I've been looking at the violent crime rate history for CS.  As with most crime trends, it goes up and down.  There are numerous times in the last 30 years where the violent crime rate has been higher (sometimes much higher) than what we've seen the last few years.  So no, violent crime in CS really isn't any worse than it has been for decades."

There are at least threes legal/moral issues that require distinction re Omar Kadar. First, he was a child soldier (15) at the time he was captured, and was not treated as such by the US. Second, there was his incarceration and torture at Gitmo by US. Both those are US issues. Third, the actions of the Canadian government in relationship to Kadar, a Canadian citizen. This later is the only issue involved in the apology and compensation.

The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled three times that the Canadian government did violated its obligations towards one of it citizens. Although the court did not rule on a redress for his government's violations of his constitutional rights, there was a suit pending to determine recompense, and had it gone to trial the government would have had to pay a lot more.

Basically, Obama has put the U.S. at nuclear risk starting to equal that of the Cold War, has brought the world closer to an all out nuclear war in the middle east and on his arrogant way out gives Israel's enemies even more encouragement to go after Israel.

The man is a dangerous fool - good riddance to him."

"I am so very happy to read this. Martin is free to go and speak against the Church and the teachings of Christ or any other subject he wants , at non-Catholic venues. Catholic organizations, need to weed out those whose goal is to lead souls away from Christ, no matter what the topic is. Yes, Martin has been called a heretic. Look it up. He fits the definition. A very holy man, Charles J. Chaput has an excellent article in First Things October issue and the difference in  his words and the words of Martin are so revealing as to each man's relationship with Christ. I recommend everyone check out his article, ""The Splendor of Truth.""  He  points out that intrinsically evil acts aren't wrong because the law proscribes them. The law proscribes them, because by their very nature, they deform the human person.
When one has failed to understand the basic teachings of the Church, as Martin has failed to do, he must be censured.  (as should his order and the Bishops that support him)"

"I recently read a Globe piece wherein Ontario's Solicitor General called out the dispensaries, putting them on notice that the SWAT teams were forthcoming. How arrogant can one ignoramus be permitted to behave? You don't shut these folks down until you're prepared to actually enter the marketplace! Case in point: Hamilton. With a population of over 500,000 the small city currently has about 22 dispensaries: about 1 for every 28,000 Hamiltonians. 

In their infinite wisdom, ON'Gov will open 1 CCBO outlet. The genius is palpable, no? Unless this retail offering is the size of Costco it will fail miserably, and serve only to prop up the black market. And what do the feds/provinces have to say about this? Nada.

"Ontario's electricity costs are a result of shameless government stupidity to the amount of $140 billion dollars, as identified by the Auditor General. The ""green"" economy is a lie promoted by short-sighted self-serving lobbyists - Ontario is paying for power it doesn't need and paying the US grids to take it because they can't give it away. Ontario is even paying ""green"" producers not to produce power at the same time that Ontario shuts down more efficient natural gas and coal power that produces energy at a fraction of the cost of wind and solar, which are incredibly inefficient on an industrial scale. It's not a secret that Ontario's ""green"" push was based on a lie by smug pig-headed blowhards like Gerald Butts who talked about ""climate change"" when shutting down Ontario's coal had virtually no impact on air quality, the statistics speak louder than the outspoken ignorance of Butts' tweets.

Aberdeen already has these things, most constructed by private enterprise. This is supposed to be about promoting business. Do we want a taxpayer-funded facility competing with the private sector?

The authors of the study describe their plan as ""a novel approach to operating a visitor center."" In this context ""novel"" means new, as in ""nobody has done this before.""  Novel also means ""a work of fiction.""

There are few certainties in life. The study promises none, saying the center ""could"" work ""if executed under the right ownership and governance model."" The ""right model"" is not defined.

"There have been many terrorist attacks attempting to kill Americans - the fact that the terrorist wasn't successful in completing the end goal of killing as many Americans as he could doesn't mean anything : The intent was there.

Remember the Boston Marathon that blew up 280 Americans?   Not on the list, but a clear case of vetting FAIL.    

Let's just take Syria for an example.    They are in the middle of a civil war and have no functioning counterparts to our authorities trying to investigate people trying to come to our country.    How on earth are you going to investigate people from territory that the Syrians don't even control?    You can't!

The other countries have been found lacking, and until they improve their cooperation to our professionals satisfaction, there will be no immigration.    

Downplaying attempts to kill Americans certainly doesn't lend your side credence.   The intent was clearly there and there are many such cases from those listed countries."
"Canada's woeful energy policies are effectively transferring billions of dollars of wealth every year to the United States.

We should be heralding the Innovation and competence of Canada's oil sands energy producers like Suncor, Husky and CNQ, companies who have made a go of it even in a very challenging oil price environment.

"I read the Wharton Study's first three conclusions,  and they are all based on theory, not evidence.  First, they claim that any immigration causes positive economic effects.  Secondly they claim that Americans who lose their jobs to illegal or legal immigrants are outweighed by the positive effects of the immigrants, and thirdly they claim that the use of immigrants to nanny children allows American women to more fully participate in the economy. As if Americans cant be nannies.  One only needs to remember that Marx was an economist and his theories on the organization of Russia's economy bankrupted the country and are about to do the same to Venezuela."

"We'll see if they open more areas to oil exploration than Clinton or Obama, I doubt they will. There will no doubt be more logging as the Republicans already have a bill that may close access to Federal lands for just that reason, and the big enemy of Alaska logging, Republican John Sununu, is no longer involved. As far as fisheries it may be tenuous times as Senator Sullivan and Trump want to go after the EPA so they can open more mines, which, btw, are taxed by a law written in 1872. We'll see, I'm skeptical for benefits to Alaska as we depend on the price of oil and Trump may help bring Russian oil on line which does us no good at all."
"Nice idea--until you remember it was Republicans, led by Bob Corker, who turned the Constitution's treaty requirement upside down so Obama could get what he wanted.

While profits and executive pay have gone thru the roof the average worker has remained stagnant for 40+ years now. Just look at the stats and see. Wake up Teddy and see how the destruction of unions has forced down wages while CEO pay has escalated beyond reason. High wages are what lifted our levels of society in the 50's and early 60's ... what has high level of executive pay done for society except bring hard feelings and tension. What you get is jerks like Trump telling people a big fat lie and promising them gold and delivering them sawdust.

"Seriously - you shop for 30 years at retail stores without returning a single item and then suddenly you are being banned for frequent returns on Amazon.

None of that makes sense or is even remotely believable.  If for no other reason than from the fact that no reasonable person would continue ordering and returning products to the point of being banned from shopping.  Particularly if they had such great success of never having a defective product or the need to return a product in 30 years.  Seriously most people would stop ordering well before the point of Amazon taking notice of the frequency.

My point isn't to suggest that Amazon is perfect or that people won't be occasionally unhappy or dissatisfied - but rather that your portrayal of the typical shopping experience was anything but typical.

But my bigger question is why on earth did you tempt fate with online shopping with that kind of shopping satisfaction track record over the past 30 years?"

"What an astonishingly ignorant man Trump is. Designation as a national monument is not a ""federal land grab"", since those lands already belong to all the people of the United States, under the management of the federal government. Trump is not giving those lands ""back to the states and to the people,"" since the states never owned them, and they were not, as monuments, taken from the people. To the contrary, monument status saved those lands for all the people, and not for Rio Tinto or some other foreign mining company to fence in and turn into pit mines.

Is Trump really this ignorant? Or is he using lies to create confusion as to who owns those lands, the people to whom they belong, or the exploiters who would take them for themselves exclusive of public interest? In one case he is incompetent, in the other case, corrupt. No president has ever reversed national monument status in US history. Probably this isn't legal, but with our new Supreme Court, who knows?"

Instead, the EC has abdicated that responsibility in favor of rubber stamping the current political flavor of the day. Then there are those who grasp at straws to defend their geniality and cite to good people - like Joe Biden - as precedent setting, when in fact he did exactly nothing to set a precedent.

However, the disasters Trump will bring on this country will fall on the white uneducated, middle class with little to no financial cushion much harder than on anyone else. The uneducated white males who elected him are the vulnerable ones, and they will not like what happens next.

"It is interesting to me that your article about Minneapolis-St. Paul has comments closed.  That said, the real problem that out church has yet to face is the role of celibacy and clericalism that protected priests and not children.  The idea that celibacy makes a person special and or closer to God is very poor thinking.  Deprivation of any sort often leads to anger and loss of ethical control.  The other problem with celibacy is that it leads the person into more schizoid personality traits.  For real healing and for the church to turn the page on this horrible scandal that really caused the ""soul murder"" of children, the church must look at the problems of clericalism and celibacy and quit hiding behind statements like ""but there really are many more holy priests than bad ones.""  Yes the Church is also bound to attempt to make the lives of the abuses better."

Oh, but there will always be individuals, one might argue.  Perhaps, but aren't we also told that when bishops act in concert, they cannot be wrong, for Jesus protects His church?

The simple truth is that the bishops ARE very much acting in concert here.  It's not an accident, nor an individual's choice, that bishops have not accepted accountability.  Rather, that's a worldwide choice by ALL of them to adopt a position that has the effect to choose themselves and their positions, over children.

Several are, the previous Harper gov for making homes to readily available with 40 year mortgages, the current gov not being more forceful to draw in the speculators, and finally the man himself Poloz for keeping rates as low as possible and making money as cheap as ever.   With these in place off course the ""consumer"" would gorge on debt."
"Mr. Zinke is, rather clearly and to no ones suprise, simply a puppet for the extraction industries.  The status of monument protects lands from destruction by such industries and preserves it for the use and enjoyment of all Americans.  The assertion that such status ""locks up the lands"" and ""keeps Americans out"" is, succinctly put, a DAMN LIE.  It does ""keep out"" loggers, strip miners, and uncontrolled ""free-loading"" cattle and sheep grazing.  Read the regulations for US monuments for yourself before you believe the propaganda from the extraction industrial interests.  Gary Crum"

 Faith is a gift from god...without faith it is impossible to believe...all sinners are void of faith. if they believe it is because they were predestined before the world formed. pseudo Christians do not like these text, and explain them away claiming their god foresaw who would choose Christ and yet the text plainly states ALL rejected Christ."

"Dean Clark. Here we go again. Yes, the Democratic Party of 1860 was the conservative party. Yes, it was the conservative party that spawned the KKK. The Republican Party of 1860 was the progressive party that wanted to do away with slavery. But this now, not 150 years ago. I won't debate you about it, but I do have one question for you. If the current day Republican Party was the progressive party, would you still be a member of that party? I know I wouldn't be a member of the Democratic Party of 1860. So please stop using an out of date comparison. You can't be a current member of the Republican Party and a progressive."
"That's just the way it is. Indeed, delivery of those agents is the wild card associated with those weapons. Dispersal is contingent on environmental factors and the type of ordnance used to deliver them. Moreover, Sarin is a binary weapon  in other words kind of like epoxy glue, it is made up of two components that are not toxic until you put them together. The notion that a wayward rocket hit a dump where inert sarin was stored, magically mixed it somehow without incinerating it and then dispersed the agent over a wide area is ridiculous. This is a desperate story cooked up in a hurry by people who obviously didn't think they were going to need a story."

"Let me explain something to you: Liberal anger is not about losing the election. America lost the election. Our last president was erudite, civil, and knowledgable about American gubmit. He began his time in office with calls for bipartisanship and the response from Republicans was an immediate declaration of all-out scorched earth warfare, political obstruction and sabotage. Obama and his family were called apes, communists, smeared with fantastic claims of birtherism. You then continued this egregious and abusive course by nominating and electing an ignorant megalomaniac whose campaign began with insults and personal attacks and went on to endless fantastic lies and ridiculous promises, and has continued in this vein without slacking. Trump has the leadership abilities and ethics of an unsocialized two-year old, and appears to have no actual knowledge on any subject whatsoever. He accommodates racism. You're trying to disguise malignant by calling it ""snarky.""

That isn't insurance, it's robbery. Even the CBO said a large number of those losing health insurance would be because they chose to.

Perhaps it was that poor schooling that leads one to say foolish things  like 1/3 live in poverty (about 10% live in poverty in AK), and that 1/3 of households make over 100K."

"This bill was always about cancelling the lopsided financing and of the Affordable Care Act, which could have been done by adjusting payroll tax rules for everyone in a revenue neutral way.  Adjusting insurance eligibility rules to make them more attractive to younger people, and maybe cheaper because a more general payroll tax would raise more money would have also been doable. Gutting Medicaid because it was Ryans childhood dream should never have happened. You can only gut Medicaid if you replace it with a public option, which was not happening without Democratic votes. Ryan tried to buy off the bishops by including the Stupak language. It did not work. An open rule may have saved this bill, but I doubt Ryan has ever seen one. In the end, Obamacare is toast because the IRS is no longer enforcing the mandate, per executive order. This will lead to insurace company bankruptcy and eventaul single payer. Thanks, Trump."

"Interesting to see how many people here are sure Dalton has other victims.  Why?  Because, apparently, ""everybody knows"" that pedophiles are just sex maniacs, can't help themselves.  In fact, very little is known scientifically about pedophile behavior, for the simple reason that even to mention pedophilic interest--even to your therapist--is to invite being treated exactly like a turd.  In reality, a great deal of child sexual exploitation, especially in family settings, is impulsive, and if the offender is caught and punished, the likelihood of reoffending is low.  The myth of the invariably recidivist pedophile got started a few decades ago and has caused immense harm to offenders while doing nothing to protect victims."

"Now to the most difficult part of the issue. What to do about young people who choose to be polygamous husbands or wives?

In the broad picture, it's not a problem. Young adults are lawfully free- and must be free- to make their own choices, good or bad. On the other hand there is a tiny subset of young people who, as children, may be inculcated with the belief that their natural role is to be a polygamous husband or wife. While that may seem alien to many, polygamy among consenting adults is not a violation of anyone's human rights. A violation of human rights would be to teach children that they have no choice in the matter.

The blanket prohibition on having more than one conjugal partner at a time appears to be unconstitutional. If so, then Blackmore and Oler may continue ""shacking up"" with any number of adult women. However their unions are definitely not marriages under Canadian law, or as viewed by most Canadians."

"""Are White Republicans More Racist Than White Democrats?

When it became obvious that his offense pluralized and that he showed no signs of stopping, I then had to tell her that she was not ""forgiving"", but rather she was ""enabling"" his activities, and that I could no longer support her unless she set him out to the curb. The same principle applies to Bill and Hillary."

"The only way for the BC Liberals to rid themselves of hubris is to spend a term on the backbenches. Their arrogance is a result of being continually re-elected, and they believe that there is nothing they can do wrong,  that a smile from the Premier and a bucket of pre-election money cannot fix.

Even now the BC Liberal backroom will be buzzing with another roll-out of election goodies to try and quickly distract the electorate from this report.  As if the loss of a young man's life, and the destructions of others,  were simply an annoyance the Liberals want to distract us from as fast as they can.

"Fr. Martin is a treasure and if anyone can build bridges between the gay community and the Catholic Church, it's he. However, speaking as a gay person on the fringes of the Church, I can tell you that it's going to be a very steep road for him to hoe. Most gay people leave the church the instant they can for all the obvious reasons and the very last thing 99.99% of gay people are interested in doing is giving the church ""the gift of time"" to ""get to know you."" Most gay people would say, ""you had your chance, church, and you blew it - we're out of this toxic environment in order to save our mental and spiritual health. Go find someone else to preach to."" I speak from the experience of visiting several other blogs that are mostly frequented by gay men, and I can assure readers here that there is 0% interest in having anything to do with the church. Perhaps when doctrine changes there might be that possibility. But until then, gay people just aren't interested, and with very good reason."

Later, st. Paul's hospital was given research grants to study HIV and AIDS, they decided to use the DTES as the test guinea pig to distribute needles with a volunteer group (non-medical volunteers that were already doing that and passing out condoms), they claimed it reduced the spread of the disease but it never did.

Can people control climate? Unlikely   99.9+% of gases in Earth's atmosphere are not there by or under the control of any government. The science on whether CO2, the building block of all life on Earth, warms the Earth is mixed at best. As it has risen the Earth's temperatures have not. It was no warmer in 2016 than in 1998, for example. What affects temperatures the most is, of course, the Sun. El Nino and La Nina, two natural phenomena are unrelated to CO2 and scientists have no firm conclusion on what causes them. So the charade that we can control the Earth's climate needs to be challenged. Do we put energy into the atmosphere? Yes. Is it significant enough to change the climate? So far the evidence doesn't match the claims or modelling.

"""After opposition parties refused to consider Liberal changes that would have provided more predictability for government legislation, Ms. Chagger bit back, saying they should expect time allocation more often on government legislation in order to speed up the passage of government bills.""

That is one way to spin it. The truth is that the liberals introduced changes to legislative procedure that effectively amount to permanent time allocation on 100% of bills introduced in the HOC. There is nothing wrong with using time allocation. There is nothing wrong with using your time to filibuster either. Both are perfectly legal and democratic tools.

When our electoral system elects a conservative government it is broken, but when it elects Liberals it is fine. When the LPC and NDP filibuster an the Conservative government has to use time allocation they are ""shutting down debate"", but when the Liberals propose changes that will permanently shut down debate that is AOK.

LAD also caught a break playing the Giants, who made several mental errors and defensive lapses. Hunter Pence in right field, letting a short fly drop while the infielder is back peddling, not once, but two nights in a row. Didn't look like he called the guy off.

I'll give Darvish some credit for last night, not overpowering, but he built some momentum, albeit against a team in disarray.

"Thank you Governor Walker.  It is definitely time for the legislature to move out of the palace they so desire to remain in.  

What seems to be missing in the latest arguments is  the millions of dollars in additional costs for keeping the LIO office in its current location (such as building maintenance)...costs that were that were previously identified but seem to be conveniently ignored by our legislature now in their attempt to make the palace seem cost comparable.  

The legislature needs to move into the Atwood Building, space that is already available and start looking at saving the State some money.  I desire for the Governor to ""get into legislative business"" when it comes to situations like this.  If the legislature had acted responsibly, this LIO debacle would never have occurred or would have been done away with a long time ago, ending Senator Stevens complaint that ""it's just one damn thing after another""."
"They way we have been using money is completely WRONG. Money should not be in the hands of the banks and government it should be in the hands of the community and village.
Money should not be a weapon and that is exactly how it is used today. This basic income scheme is an excellent idea.  It will infact help Canada grow socially and economically and ultimately prosper.
-
How can anyone be happy when Canada gives away 120 million dollars to developing nations when families and communities in Canada can hardly afford to eat? What is the sense in that. To supplement a few million people with 10-20k a year is nothing in the great economic scheme of things. This supplement will actually make Canada money because people will be happy to work harder and give back to the community that has given them so much. There is no reason anyone in Canada should live in poverty, this is just a problem with economics."

And then they wonder why people are mocking them."

"""If you level the playing field, you will not eliminate the kind of discrimination that insurers practice altogether, but you will make the actuarial calculations and the pooling of risk more precise.""

If you follow this logic, where do you stop? There is all sorts of personal information that could be harvested to make better insurance decisions. Liking extreme sports webpages on Facebook is probably correlated with a higher rate of death by injury. Does that mean that insurance companies should have access to our social media? 

Furthermore, many of the ways in which companies discriminate are based on quasi-voluntary characteristics, like smoking. There is nothing one can do to change their genetic structure and it will never change throughout one's lifetime. Why exactly do we want to give insurance companies a way to make insurance inaccessible to the genetically unlucky?"

If that's true, soon, all national parks will be operated as for-profit business by the Chinese.  but what of the land beneath the federal buildings in Washington?  Will we have to pay rent to use them?  Wouldn't that be choice:  The president's paying rent to live at the White House?"

"It's interesting watching and listening to the protests going on in response to Donald Trumps' assumption of the presidency. These people are supposed to be protesting against Turmps intolerance, bullying, treatment of woman, promotion of fear of Muslims etc. What I'm seeing and hearing from these protesters and the organizers is no less hate filled, intolerant (see the exclusion of a feminist, pro life group of woman from the march), bullying (see the pressure put on celebrities by other celebrities to get into the group think against Trump), and outright ridiculous (see Madonna thought about 'blowing up the White House') than that which they are accusing Trump of.  I have one word for these folks - hypocrites. They aren't prepared to accommodate anyone who doesn't see the world the way they do. This doesn't bode well for social peace in the future."
"That's why it's called *assisted* suicide, Layla4 - because it's consented to and initiated by the person who wants to die.

But you CAN type out the words ""killing babies"" and for people without a scientific education, folks such as yourself, these silly words have an emotional appeal.

"As far as the credit for low-income renters goes, I think its important to remember that if a couple has adjusted gross income over $30,000, they dont qualify at all.  Note that a renter with social security and non-taxable pension income of over $30,000 could qualify, however. 

The credit is $50 per exemption, so a qualifying family of four would get $200, which comes nowhere near the amount of GET in rent, even at $1,000/month.  A retired couple (over age 65) bringing in social security and pension income of $50,000 or more could also get a credit of $200."
"I knew two. One was a pompous, arrogant fool of a man. Both went to Ampleforth, both sets of parents earned their fortune in the third world, both family names treble-barrelled, both men went into the Army at officer level, both millionaires, and both with the arrogance to regularly complain to the Bishop in that shrill, ""this really will not do.."", voice, every time they felt ""the lay faithful may well be led into error.""

First, four years of a pugnacious bully wont be enough to completely unravel the strategic and economic alliances the US has with the other members of the G7.  Dont forget, many industry, state, and local leaders have spoken out against Trumps shortsightedness.

Second, the West without the United States will likely not be a fun place.  Yes, they overstep their bounds in banana republics and the Middle East, and their unwavering faith in their sense of purpose is reminiscent of Il Duce always being right.  But while they are a somewhat strange bedfellow, I think they are infinitely preferable to the alternative.  Does anyone really want China holding the balance of power?"

Pull quote:

""As the mythology goes, these misfortunes are visited upon Black Americans exclusively because our feeble minds have been brainwashed by the Democratic Party plantation.

Never mind the scores of White Americans in Appalachia, the Deep Red South, and the Rust Belt, who religiously vote Republican, and still live in the exact same socioeconomic conditions Trump describes.

Never mind the fact that the majority of Black Americans are considered middle class, just as the majority of White Americans are.""

As long as the condescending Southern Strategy GOP keeps patronizing and belittling black Americans and taking away any agency black people have, you'll never earn the black vote. Never."
"Proclaiming, just days after the horror in Orlando, that ""There is nothing sadder than watching Hawaiis struggling Republican Party sink lower and lower"" seems incredibly insensitive.

She regularly sees $5-7000  dental bills for a single patient NOT a family. This is just the tip of iceberg......saunter on over to the food stamp or aid to children or welfare offices. The bills are huge and I suspect larger than this article cites. Sickening, really and a huge magnet for more to cross the border. 

Why would anyone even suggest they pay their fair share of taxes? They are here illegal and if not here, the jobs would be filled by our own tax paying citizens if we reduced entitlements to our own never do well citizens."

Because I grew up in Anchorage I care about my community and especially our youth . I don't bring up the issue of drugs unless the Dispatch mentions it.  The Dispatch and most commenter's love and promote pot.  Only a hand full of us speak out against it , so I hope your tender feelings aren't hurt that a few voices disagree with you.  While not as bad as alcohol , pot is still a drug that causes problems . In Palmer a youth was killed and the explanation offered by one of those involved as to the motive was the victim used up all of their pot.  Many home invasions and shooting in Alaska are over pot.  As a society we are better off with fewer people messed up .  Pot use shouldn't be encouraged and celebrated .  It's a shame so many people like yourself think getting high is great .  Drugs kill."
"I thought tax-credits worked towards reducing a companies overall tax bill. Kind of like our federal income tax, you can only deduct as much as you've paid.  So, this company should only be getting tax credits up to the amount of the taxes he's paid. If he's not paying a tax, then the tax credit shouldn't be available. What am I missing here, besides a clearly broken system?
How are we loaning money to outside business folks (who state they are only here because the tax credits were too good to pass up), w/a $4 billion deficit?

We need to change this law that keeps us from knowing how much us paid to each company with tax credits. This is ridiculous. We're not talking about thousands of dollars, not even millions, this is billions of dollars our state is paying companies to setup business in the state.  If we can afford to cover over half of the costs, why doesn't the state build our own projects, hire Alaskans, and recycle the tax credits back into our states?"

Empowered is the wrong word.  Lower ratings means lower revenue which means lower salaries.  Trump is a fool for throwing gas on a dying fire and the players are fools for offending their fans.

"Personally, I prefer socialism for the simple fact that it at least tries to keep the arrogant rich under control, and makes everyone, including the rich children of Trump and Brooks, serve their country in some way, perhaps not military, but at least national service.
As it is, the kids of the rich get to enjoy all the opportunities of this country , but suffer none of the responsibilities. They get the best medical care, education, therapy, homes, hope, whatever, and the children of the very poor get to look to futures competing with the kids of Vietnam or Mexico or China, where unions are forbidden and where the living standards let them at least have a sense of belonging.

"It's exceptionally funny, because it is true.  I should qualify that Trudeau is a Canadian version of Trump.  Less bombastic with a more Canadian/ subtle display of narcissism, but there really is no difference other than a lack of Tweeting and a New York City attitude.  Trump does listen to people.  He listens and repeats advice from Steve Bannon, Fox and Friends, Jared Kushner et al.  Trudeau also listens not to Canadians, but to McKenna and Butts.   Your insults thrown to those with differing opinions is quite toxic and unproductive.  I'm a Liberal supporter, but not of the type that supported the scandal plagued McGuinty-Wynne Ontario crew running Ottawa.  I think apprehension to Trudeau's advisors and their advice in this situation is fair based on history.  I'm hoping for the day that merit and at least some integrity, along with real qualifications, return as core competencies for being put under consideration for election to the top offices of both of our countries."

"Trump is arguably the worst president in the history of the USA - he get my vote.  But he is a brilliant strategist/tactician.  In spite of having his party in control of both parties in the Congress:
- Obamacare has not been repealed/replaced
- no tax reform
- no infrastructure plan
- no wall
- up to his ass in Russian collusion investigations
And what has he got people talking about?

"This serves as a graet indication of how warped are the minds of the leftists. Consider, every one of these fools are seeking ""leadership"" from a president of the US. The president is the leader of the federal government...NOT individual citizens. As an adult, sentient being, I do not need any idiot politician as my leader. In fact, if you try and be my ""leader"", whoever you are, my reaction is more akin to kicking your teeth in, rather than accept your meddling, or vote for you.

This is a great indication of the mindset of leftists. These idiots believe they need a leader. Their very words prove they're no better than mere sheep. While that is consistent with interactions with mindless leftists (sorry for the redundancy), it is quite interesting to hear the sickos actually admit it."

"The article truly exposes the anti-Middle America attitude among the GOP Establishment.

"Part 2
Given these tea leaves, I imagine what we have here is a gay priest or perhaps a sexually confused priest making a foolish unspecified sexual overture to a young man which was refused and not pressed. There are no reports of any further sexual impropriety with this minor or anyone else. Forty years later the incident is reported to the police and presumably was made public. The police presumably investigated, and did not find any evidence of the sort of persistent sexual abuse with this accuser or any others that is almost always there when we are dealing with sexual abuse of minors.

I sense, Mokantz, that you have been following this case. If so, prior to considering the stupid bishop's actions, are there any good reasons to imagine a different set of underlying facts? If so, then everything then please ignore everything that follows. 

If these are more or less the facts, how ought the bishop to have acted? What would I have done in his position?"

"Druggies look for nice, weak individuals to exploit.  If you wish to be exploited, fine, but NOT  when that  exploitation exploits me and my family!   Drug abusers are among the most selfish people in society. When they're done using up friends and families for their selfishness, they turn on strangers to abuse.
.
 If you are a druggie, here's a suggestion...... Quit using, shape yourself up and get a job!  People may be willing to help when they see honest ""results"" and not more excuses that its a  disease or 'its not my fault'.  People have had it with that!   The Lord helps those who help themselves. Jesus never expected Christians to be 'chumps'.  Helping a druggie continue to use is being a chump with a capitol 'C' And it is absolutely NOT Christian to 'help' a drug abuser use drugs! In doing so, you hurt them as well as your neighbors."

Walrus Islands Archeological District is one of the few remaining places with evidence  of human occupation of the Bering Sea continental shelf when sea levels were substantially lower than at present. Most of the evidence of outer coastal prehistoric life in Alaska is submerged and likely destroyed by ocean currents.

The earliest inhabitants of Round Island, one of seven islands in the district, were marine adapted  and practiced more generalized settlement and subsistence patterns than previously recognized by Alaska researchers. At least 6,000 years ago people hunted walrus on the beaches of Round Island, leaving evidence of the earliest human-walrus relationship in the nation, which continues to today."

"In this day and age, car makers dump production quickly from vehicles that don't sell. When you sell some 600 models and your competition sells 27,000 I think I know where the answer lies on why they cut production. And to top it off their sales were decreasing while Jeep was increasing.

You can bet your last paycheck that if Toyota sold 20,000 FJ's in 2014 they would still be around today. You can make up all the excuses you want about  Fuel consumption but that logic applies to all car makers and not just Toyota. I mean isn't that why Toyota makes the Prius line!!!

Sure their owners like them, what would you say if you dumped 50 grand on a product. The point is the non owners and those about to buy that type of vehicles didn't and choose to buy something else. Add insult to injury is that Jeep owners are very loyal and they have the best resale in the industry. That wouldn't happen if as if you say they were junk. Use you head."

"About 415 million Europeans cannot compete with Google, Amazon, Facebook, Oracle, Intel, Apple, etc. and the socialist European welfare states need more revenue because they are running out of other peoples' money.

If the the Europeans wish to engage in this transparent financial inquisition, then the US should respond with counter litigation for $trillions against corrupt scofflaws like VW ( think diesel fiddle!) as well as UBS/Credit Suisse/HSBC/Credit Lyonnaise (think tax cheats!)and sue/litigate them out of existence.

I swear, it seems as though he was channeling Sarah Palin as he rambled on, and on, and on.  I'm glad Clinton pointed out that in the two years we know about, thanks to an old court case, he didn't pay any taxes at all.  Like the Kochs, Trump essentially wants to have the billionaire class exempted from any responsibility to maintain public services.

Obama inherited an economy that was on the verge of collapse, but I don't expect your memory goes back as far as eight years. Whatever your personal situation has been, the country recovered without undergoing a depression and perhaps helping to precipitate a worldwide crash. He might have done better, had it not been for the rise of the obstructionist Tea Party which rejected the investment in infrastructure that would have produced more jobs and repaired failing bridges and highways in disrepair."
"The BoC here says that we have all this slack in the economy.   Do they realise that the excess slack in manuf, has probably taken off since the great recession and will not come back??

The fact is he is too busy covering his own s to MAGA. Most responsible adults who have normal thought processes are awaiting exactly what you have stated the reasons that he got elected. It is obvious that the Chumps presidency is in such disarray that they are literally running out of excuses for their abundance of miscues. His communications staff have become zombie like at the very few press conferences that the Chump allows them to have. Transparency has been non existent with the current presidency and it is an insult to anyone of reasonable intelligence to suggest otherwise.

"The BQ was teetering but had the same support right up to the 2011 election.  
 They were decimated in Harper's third term.  Separatist support rallied around the NDP.  This was the election of the Harper majority that did not require the support of Quebec to govern.  This was the eye opener for Quebec.  They chose not to participate in governance, and instead chose to be in opposition.  Their choice to make. The PQ were elected into minority governance in 2012 and it quickly began to crumble and was gone during Harper's last term.  This all took place when the Harper government stepped back and did not interfere. Nation within a nation.
 
And yes, the NDP briefly benefitted from these conditions.  Sadly for Quebecers, the messiah they supported had cancer and was dead shortly after the 2011 election.  

This all happened in the nine years of Quebec's peaceful coexistance with Canada under Harper.  Was it wilfilly ignorant of the editorialist to completely ignore this era?  Yes."

"Living a LGBTQ lifestyle is sin. The Bible clearly addresses the issue. God teaches to love the sinner but hate the sin. As a result, the sin cannot be condoned by society. A LGBTQ lifestyle is not to be enabled and glorified. The individual is to be treated with respect, but societal accommodations simply enable the behavior and endanger the rest of society. Males and females do need their privacy in certain situations. LGBTQ behavior crosses the boundaries of that privacy, because it is scientifically impossible for humans to fully change sexes. Society cannot let people simply act in any manner they wish, for it will cause a slow deterioration of that society. 

In general, people do not like to be told what they can and cannot do. It is sad that a law like this has to be put in the books. It is sad that right is becoming wrong and wrong is becoming right. Laws forbidding marriage between the same sex and rights to privacy are far from bigotry, for It is simple consequence to sin."

The crazy left anti-Trumpers and the MSM are breeding a new generation of fascists turned brown shirts with their polemics and a dirty Mueller investigation kicking in doors in the middle of the night.  Is this incident so different than the attack on the GOP baseball team?
The use of the term corruption has been debased by the alt-right to the point of meaninglessness. They use it as a tool to undermine democracy. The lie that all politicians are corrupt is intended to weaken us by placing our system of government on a par with dictatorships and kleptocracies.

"The Yak suggests that we ""imagine how prosperous...Quebec would be"" as if the constitution had anything to do with it. Take the unions. The construction workers shut down the projects throughout the province just because they can. No other province has this all-consuming construction union control. Then there is the two week shutdown in midsummer, proviince wide. Unless you have non union construction people working for you. What has the constitution to do with that? And then there is the French language requirement which has taken much wealth out of the province by way of anglos voting with their feet, getting educated then leaving for other provinces, the French upper middle class getting top federal (bilingual essential) jobs, increasing the French Canadian population of Ottawa and emigrating, in the process from Quebec, and so on. Take the students, they shut down the universities over fee increases which are then reversed. How not to create prosperity. The Quebeckers are experts."

When you have a political leadership that rewards the families of terrorists who stab pregnant women at the grocery store, don't be surprised by the skepticism from the Israelis.

If a friend were to come to me and say that he thinks he has a priestly vocation because he feels he is called to be a ""healer"" and the sacraments could be used as instruments to that end (note that the sacraments are secondary), or that he is ""more than capable of being a 'minister'"" I'd recommend that he and I have dinner with a few priests and talk with them about how their sacerdotal ministry is different from that when they were laymen. 

If the reason someone wants to be a priest is neither the Eucharist nor Confession his ""vocation"" is likely to the common priesthood of the baptized."

"In 1978 Chile was the fastest growing economy in the world. Stocks were soaring. Every company was reporting record profits. Milton Friedman and F.A. Hayek who wrote it's libertarian economic policy used those numbers to sell the idea around the world. To Reagan in the USA and to Thatcher in Britain (which is when she told Hayek she can only do a bit of what Pinochet did -the rest are impossible in a democracy). 
In 1980 the entire economy collapsed... because none of that growth was real. There was no growth at all, and in fact the economy had been shrinking all that time (wealth concentration REDUCES growth potential by lowering the number of people who can gain the capital to start entrepreneurial ventures). All that reported growth consisted of CEOs fraudulently adding extra zeros to their financial statements.
You can't do that forever. Sooner or later shareholders figure out what you're doing - and the whole stockmarket collapses. Just like it did in Chile."

"The growing movement to attempt to ""dump"" Trump is hardly a secret.  Many Republicans worry that his heading the ticket will be a disaster for all down-ballot candidates.  This is understandable since the GOP would like to hold the Senate and House even if Hillary is elected President.  I put ""wacko right"" in quotations since its a term used by many moderate Republicans when referencing the Trump zealots.  If you have a euphemism you'd find less offensive, please suggest it.  It will be interesting to see if the ""mainstream"" Republicans can ""house train"" Trump...so far they've had no success.  Shortly after Paul Ryan endorsed him, he launched a racist attack on the judge preciding over the lawsuit against Trump University; placing Ryan in the very awkward position of, as I've mentioned, endorsing and condemning him simultaneouosly.

Oh yes it did. The two idiot hierarchs at the Vatican who met with Joan's Prioress will certainly do their homework next time. You see they conversed with the Prioress in English (concerning Joan going to this conference). Then the two idiot hierarchs conversed between themselves in Spanish (they must have thought she was a fool). Then these same two hierarchs went back to conversing with the Prioress in English. So the good Prioress responded to these two fools in Spanish (since she had a PhD in Spanish and spoke the language perfectly). I love it when religious women slap ignorent hierarchs across the face without using their hands. Can you imagine an educated woman confronting two Vatican fools.
"''Think about it'' 

Think about it some more.

Your comment is a variation of what is sometimes called the Fallacy of Pathos. i.e. ""that one's emotions, urges or ""feelings"" are innate and in every case self-validating, autonomous, and above any human intent or act of will (one's own or others), and are thus immune to challenge or critique"".

No one is dismissing any of what you point out. But it cannot be rationally used as a justification. To react to difficult circumstances does not require a racist or bigoted response. That is a separate choice that an individual makes. And is often made without full knowledge or grasp of the facts - poor education, poverty and wilful ignorance, being the shaky foundation upon which many of  these choices are made."

He also said that the Republican Party, which he has supported for nearly seventy years (almost half of its existence), is finished.  He sees no way that it can survive what it has done to itself.

NO ONE CARES GARY!!!! And at least the current system is transparent... with payments by individuals, corporations, unions to political parties recorded and, due to BC laws, made public... 

This would not remain the case if in future payments by corporations and unions to political parties & their candidates are banned... These payments, to some degree, would just move behind the scenes.... 

AND EVEN IF DONATIONS FROM CORPORATIONS/ UNIONS WERE BANNED IN BC, THE BC NDP WOULD STILL BE CONTROLLED BY UNIONS!!- the party's constitution guarantees BC's biggest unions' members senior administrative positions in BC NDP.

The democrats were smarter than the republicans at that time in electing candidates.  They would run a single candidate for an office.  The Republicans might run two or three candidates.  If the republicans did not, the democrats might find a weak candidate to run as a republican.  Since the democrat would be on the general election ballot automatically, the democrats would switch over and vote for the weakest republican candidate - the one that the democrat could more easily defeat in the general election. I remember when the democrats crossed-over to select the Republican C.R. Lewis, and then defeated him in the general election.

"Just a few casual observations from someone who moved here 4 years ago from a major metro area where I drove for a living for over 20 years. I drove well over 50,000 miles a year so I have spent over a 1,000,000 miles behind the wheel of various vehicles, mostly mid sized trucks.

For starters most Alaskans are very poor drivers. This is not surprising, nor is this an insult. In a rural state with few roads, low traffic and even fewer expressways there is little opportunity to learn the skills that can keep one alive in high speed, high traffic situations.

More troubling is that so many Alaskans drive aggressively and wear their emotions on their sleeve. This combination of low skills and angry, aggressive driving is deadly. I learned long ago that driving is the most dangerous thing I do. The first key to safety is controlling my emotions! I know my skills are modest. I look well down the road, drive the speed limit and NEVER tailgate.

This, when unemployment peaked at 12%. Amazing, no?  (see more, Boat-people, a Refugee Crisis.)  More amazing: didn't ""sink our own boat, either.  Canada seemed to do okay afterward.

At that point i knew something wasn't right and began to do a lot of research. Then I found Lisas diabetes story (google "" HOW EVER I FREED MYSELF FROM THE DIABETES "" ) I read that article from end to end because everything the writer was saying made absolute sense.

I agree 0.4% mom would be great but we will average at best around 1.5% which  is horrendous in the system we have created. The best word in your comment is the if we did that every month. With this PM I would wager my entire collection of precious metals, which is far more than our entire nation, that this blip of growth will not continue."
"America's obsession with perfecting laziness results in fraudsters trying to save a buck by overcutting their parmesan with cellulose fillers... SMH

What people don't know can't hurt them, right? Get a damn grater and a piece of parmesan. Keep it and grate as neccesary over foods. Its really easy. I promise. And it tastes way better too. But who cares.  I know nobody has two extra seconds to shave a bit of parmesan. It's ok, keep buying your mystery crumbles and hope for the best. 

That's what cooks in restaurants for. Pay them for good food, and throw half of it away. Waste is your status symbol. The haute don't have a dime to spare for anyone,  saying ""What can you do for me?"" Yet they always have extra money to toss in the trashcan.

 """"I'm a winner, I get ahead in life buying pre-grated cheese! I can't be bothered to grate my own! My trendy life is too hectic, no extra second to spare!"" Watching people needlessly run this silly rat-race is equal parts depressing and ridiculous."
"Keep it up, Syria!  Go go, Russia!

The world is grateful for your determination to defeat the evil of Islamofascist terror."
There are too many rat's in the cellar. It's time to execute some of these traitors including some that reside in the White House.
"I agree he is his own worst enemy. He does say many stupid things and takes unusual positions on issues. He would not be my choice for President however neither would Clinton be. Almost any other democrat would have beat Trump. The Democratic Party chose the wrong candidate, that's why they lost. Too many people thought she broke the law, and then lied about it to the public. That's why she's not president today."
"I understand it very well. You're right, however you can also smear others by saying things about them that are not true. A smear is a false accusation intended to damage someone's reputation, documentation or not. Let's put you in front of camera that records your opinion on safe sex and then edits to its owners intent. Will the sex toys be included?"
Ya...  because Norway is such a hell hole right?
"Depending on your asset base and new contributions, you should consider diversifying. 5 stocks is very concentrated - even more so if there is more than one in the same industry."
It's one thing to not like a restaurant. It's another thing to be a total ass about it. The photos are not good and this review is self important and ridiculous.
"You do understand there's a difference between being arrested and convicted, right?

Kind of like how there's a difference between committing a crime and failing to comply with a law?"
Time well spent.
"So negative here...

Justin's debt increases and taxation have tanked the value of the Canadian dollar so Canada is in fact becoming an alternative to China and India for cheap labour. The Americans can come here, snap up our housing and assets on the cheap and then employ us to clean their homes and build cheap junk in their factories. Win win."
No. Those states gave NP the right to practice independently based on extensive lobbying by the nursing organizations. Hopefully true studies will now be done.
"Canadas fiercely anti-Russian Foreign Affairs Minister      Funny, I would agree with this whole-heartedly, she is anti-Russian.   Shame most Canadians I know aren't, but we are now expected to be. 

 Sorry G&M, this is pathetic.   I encourage everyone to read RT.  Does it have a slant...sure sometimes, but never as extreme as western msm.  But we plebeians are only expected to adhere to western propaganda (ex. Aleppo human rights issues while Mosul is a picnic).     

  Also outside the family stuff, do you notice they never provide ANY substance to their claims of misinformation.   Time for her to go, why are we spending millions and millions of OUR tax dollars  defending a corrupt country that needs to sort itself out.   And when can we expect Freeland to talk about the coup that took place and the corruption in Ukraine.  To do otherwise is clearly misinformation Freeland.   And care to show show some Integrity and speak about Israel Freeland.  Hypocrites!!!"
Yeah she was horrible.  Just a grating voice.  And next to a windbag.
"You are nothing more than an empty head blowhard, regurgitating rhetoric like a good little parrot. You are worse than those who you malign because you make up lies and claim them as facts. Parrot on while we laugh at you."
"I'm sure ""our best friend in the Middle East"" will give us a hand in this war."
"Yes it's hyperbole, but it is a statement worth listening to that's about more than women's rights. These commenters have not seen or given much thought to what is really going on in the Handmaids Tale. It is not a stretch to imagine a future in which horrific environmental pollution reduces birth rates and turns nations into closed off mutually-hostile garrison states where (esp women's) rights are gone. When we have totally trashed the planet we will get sick and turn on each other and will cease to be prosperous and free. As in the past, religion will be used as justification to control people. Christians are no innately better than people of any other religions, and presented with the awful circumstances in the Middle East would be just as bloodthirsty and cruel. While Pence and the Focus on the Family nutjobs are focusing on end days because of Jesus' second coming, they should be focusing on the more probable end days they are hastening by their own greed and shortsightedness."
Agreed -- especially your last paragraph.
"Fortunately, the technically inept, like you, dont run the ATF."
It would be nice if we could sort out the dumb ones without a margin of error.
"Remember Obama standing with Berghdahls parents in the Rose Garden saying how he served with distinction?  Then Obama ,  his administration and the corrupt Democrats including our representatives from Hawaii, released 5 of the worst terrorists in trade for him, saying it was worth it for returning an American Hero?  Then the media, building up the whole thing as a marvelous thing?  How anyone can trust these people amazes me everyday."
"This is infuriating, similar to Sen.Lesil McGuire's trip to Germany during last year's special session. It is beyond ridiculous!
HB44 to put some teeth into the Legislature's ETHICS RULES is stalled in the Senate until next January.  Let us all push to see it passed & demand ethical action by all our Legislators.
What we have now is arrogant, adolescent behavior - certainly NOT action that benefits the citizens of Alaska."
"Quite certain other young students at Oregon, be they athletes, members of the marching band, outdoor club, or any other campus activity have made similar mistakes in judgment resulting in a misdemeanor (or worse) charge.  With Carrington it's certainly a ""where there is smoke"" scenario and given the fact he's undoubtedly been advised/schooled about being a high profile athlete in little old Eugene, accountability simply must be part of any decision made going forward. If he has perhaps already been warned about ongoing/future misbehavior and/or there are other things we don't know about, cutting him loose might be warranted. I really hope the young man hasn't already used up his ""chances"" because he's very gifted at what he does on the field and the future could be bright for he and his family."
"Uh oh...the guy's learning to play the game.  The only thing I liked about the idea of Trump winning was I thought he was too stupid to catch on and play the masses like the morons they are.  If this guy learns how to lie through his teeth and come out with the masses protecting him like many other politicians do, we're in BIG trouble."
What a hypocrite if there ever was one!
"Hurrah, Canada just got voted the most reputable country in the world for this year. We even edged out the two titans, Switzerland and Sweden.   For all you negative people surrounding this posted issue, I encourage you to visit the Giant mine out in the NWT  and become educated about the toxic mess that we leaving our children. Currently this mine is being frozen to prevent a catastrophy beyond imagination. But for most of you, its the price of Chines made goods at Costco that matter, not that there are over 28,000 leaking mines in Canada.  For MOST of us, the price of gasoline, electricity and whether we can afford another vehicle to fit into our 3 car garage.  
Professor Stephen Hawkings gives us maybe 5 decades before we explode. Anyone here ha ve a post degree from Cambrigdge.  I suspect not with most coming from the PATCH.

Repeal Repeal was just a another con job by Trump and GOP on the suckers who voted for Trump.  The GOP knew they had no replacement for the ACA but it sounds better to suckers that voted for Trump that they kept repeating repeal.
"When I was a young man growing up, Donald Trump would have been arrested and convicted of Communism by the U.S. Govt. What gives with his behavior today? His top military people smoozing with the Commies, like WTH happened to the U.S.? 
 Look at any jet fighter produced by the Soviet Union and you will be able to easily compare each model to advanced aircraft produced by the United States, that tells me that Espionage is where the Russians get their Military aircraft design ideas.
 Trump jumping into bed with the Ruskies is like leaving Grandma to be babysat by the Big Bad Wolf. Trump is to dumb to run a cool-aid stand, because he want $15 dollars for a glass of Kool-aid. Trump is all hype and no-substance. Even the Russians recognize Trump as an idiot, that is WHY they have videos on his behavior.

"Let's examine 'fishing licenses'....why do Alaskan citizens need a fishing license?  [and the bureaucracy to administer it] A driver's license should suffice or a State ID.  I realize this example is rather simple but it does illustrate the excessive government we ""enjoy"". Redundant agencies,policies and excessive salaries are what is kiling the State. I'm not talking about the guys that plow the highways.  I think, if people take a hard look, they might see many places to reduce the size of the ""Alaskan Government""  - it has become way too big to regulate it's self."

"For years the climatistas have hectored those of us on the right as being anti-science.  Now Rep. Chris Tuck (D, IBEW) and Dustin Darden (D, cute signs) join forces against the evil of fluoride in city water despite nearly a century of science in support of its use.  Further, they want a toxicology workup of contaminants in the fluoride used.  What rot.

Before you get all wrapped around the axle about fluoride, I would point you to the toxic contaminants of lowly table salt - sodium and chloride (chemical equivalent to fluorine).  They are deadly by themselves. Chlorine was used as chemical munitions in WWI, yet we consume the molecule on a daily basis.  Indeed we can't live without it.  

Don't get me started about the deadliness of dihydrous monoxide which will kill in quantities as small as a liter and is responsible for most recreational deaths here in Alaska on a yearly basis.  Cheers -"

This right must apply to all, or it is meaningless. And if it is meaningless, as it is now becoming, it is one small baby step from turning a blind eye to the killing of precious children in the womb to turning a blind eye to the preventable killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians  -- which is exactly what happened in Rwanda during the Clintons' administration in the White House!"

"The compromise needs to be a maximum percentage of income for insurance. The fixed tax credit won't work. IF rates stayed the same next year (I'm sure they'll actually go up), a 64 year old making $20,000 a year will pay at least $16,808 for insurance, leaving $3,192 per year for other living expenses and taxes. Another 64 year old making $75,000 a year will pay the same $16,808, leaving $58,192 for living expenses and taxes. In both cases, I reduced the $20,808 insurance bill by the new $4,000 over age 60 tax credit. Someone brighter than me can figure out how many cell phones that is."
"The model of White privilege is absurdly reductionist. It's like trying to explain all weather by looking at lake effect. 

The fact of the matter is that there are a large number of factors that give people advantages and disadvantages. And many depend on the situation. 

The article mentioned one: growing up with two parents vs. one. But there are many more. Physical handicaps (construction work), level of beauty (everywhere), size (basketball vs. horse jockey), religion, IQ, your language skills, etc. Plus your own beliefs about whether what you do makes any difference, your work ethic, etc.

Does a butt-ugly, clinically depressed White guy who thinks the world is out to get him have more advantages than a handsome, level-headed Black dude who believes hard work is the key? In today's world? 

White privilege doesn't model any of that. It's kiddie science dressed up in adult clothes, reducing everything to the color of one's skin."

Salmon is one of our most important resources in the state and among one of our main exports; the declining population poses a threat to thousands of already established jobs (more jobs than Pebble will produce), along with communities that rely on them for their subsistance. Supporting a project such as Pebble is a very stupid move: copper prices are declining, when the minerals are extracted from the soil it will be barren... whereas salmon is a sustainable resource, if taken care properly it will keep on returning for our nourishment. There is no way around it: this proposal is good for the community, good for the environment, its action like this that is what we need to thrive as a society."

"This is a stupid poll for several reasons:

First, the total percentages add up to much more than 100%
Second, Trump's disapproval rating of 55% is nothing to cheer about since that's what Obama had when he left office.
Third, even though the disapproval rating of Congress is 66%, you're comparing apples to oranges with Trump (1 person) vs. Congress (535 persons) as Congress has had a tougher and more complex job to do than Trump has had so far. 
Fourth, Congress isn't tweeting at all hours of the day and night or holding pep rallies for its known supporters across America to bolster its image and its egos.
Fifth, Congress has never been popular with the people.

But, most critically, what the Hell does a nebulous concept such as ""Approval"" really mean?

It is not the same thing as asking someone to judge the competency or effectiveness of a person or body of persons. It's more akin to a popularity contest than any serious inquiry into the actual work being done in Washington."

I know that many racists exist but I think the DNC and MSM have you fooled, which is what they are counting from America's black community."
You son is part of a useless mission wasting Canadian resources
"Great comment coming from someone who claims to have been a lawyer.  Guilty until proven innocent.  Yes,I know you did not say he was guilty of anything, but you certainly are suggesting he has or will do something to justify impeachment."
No deceit from Hillary eh Rick? Not that it makes deceit right mind you but that issue was unfortunately off the table.
"As a 10 year old I marched with MLK with my parents. They did not give us guns for protection either. You had to be very brave to face white cops with  dogs and such. They kill black people that try to defend themselves. How many of the folks you helped kill were actually a danger to us and how many just had stuff the government wanted you to steal, like oil? I spent 13 years as a vocational counselor and helped 13,000 Lane county citizens find work and better their lives. I was paid less than the average mill workers of the time. I worked with at risk youth, welfare moms, ex-offenders, and displaced workers. I was also a founding board member for Wellspring Friends School, an alternative school that the public schools that were not serving those students well. I could go on but I know you don't care about my humanitarian successes. Why do you resent people that got college educations and worked for the good of the community? What do think an UO education is worth?"
"In the sense that everyone involved in politics is fighting for control of the outcome of whatever issues they're involved in, I suppose you're correct, but I don't think that's what you meant. 

Here, the argument was about the racist roots of the charter school movement, as well as the specific, enumerated opposition to it by a venerated civil rights organization. It wasn't some generalized, knee-jerk rejection of charters, and vouchers didn't really come up. If you'd like to argue some specifics, I'm game - but I won't be drawn into a discussion in which my opponent is armed only with Breitbart talking points, rather than facts."

Whatever Trump does is on t e heads and souls of the American Catholic prelature --  including the destruction of the death and destruction of the ME, Europe and of America and our families.  
It is the American Catholic prelates and the likes of such as the Koch bros that have driven the dumb ignorant GOP and their fear mongering, war mongering religion mongering GOP and it's stance on American Exceptionalism and Trickle-down economics that have nearly destroyed our families including the born and the unborn!!! 
Daddy Bush said publicly that poverty IS one of the greatest causes of abortions!!! That poverty is due to Trickle-down Economics. Or as daddy Bush called it voodoo economics. 
Trickle-down is the Catholic prelates answer to Fatima. It is badly misused."

  Your choice of words ('identify as') leads one to think that you realize there is a spectrum of political identity just like there is in gender identity.

If parents are in a strong financial position and their adult children are financially responsible it makes sense to give an early inheritance. I am seeing more and more elderly parents leaving substantial sums on passing to their 60 year old children. I am sure these 'kids' could have made more use of the funds in their 30's and 40's when raising their own children - I like the saying 'its better to give with a warm hand than a cold one'
"For all your hyperbole and parroting of rhetoric, Shortridge, you never come up with an intelligent argument against Clinton, nor do you list any proof that she is anything like what you would have others believe she is. Anyone can spew out the rhetoric they hear and mistake for truth, but it takes intelligence to frame an argument in a clear, concise manner, and list citations that back up their assumptions. I have to agree with your self diagnosis; you are deplorable, although that's not an honorable thing to be proudly displayed like you think it is. Try looking up the word in a dictionary."

"One thing that might be changed, quickly, is the requirement to declare income that has already been declared by an employer or pension fund on behalf an employee or retiree. 

Every year, employers, pension funds, investment firms, are required to provide income slips to both the CRA and their employees or investors. There are a variety of reasons that a person may not include these slips with a return, but when a person fails to, even though the CRA already has the information, the CRA treats the return as if fraud may have occurred. In any event, penalties are likely to be extracted, even though the CRA had all the information that it needed to fully process the return.

This appears to be a form of ""gotcha"" governance, which has its roots in a pre-computer information era where it was impossible to cost effectively process all the data related to each tax payer in a real time basis... but that has changed drastically over the past five decades."
"The most likely reason why China is cooperating is because it is sensing that the U.S. and N. Korea are getting uncomfortably close to warring with each other, and the cost to China if that were to occur, is greater than the cost to China of continuing a policy of doing nothing. 

The key here is to put China in a situation where the cost of continuing the same old policy with N. Korea is greater than the cost of doing nothing, and that's exactly what the Trump administration is doing. Well done, I say. At least we're now getting somewhere and tightening the screws on the fat little dictator.

Oh, by the way, what did 0bama do with resepct to N. Korea? ZERO - NOTHING. He had a ""head in the sand"" policy and kicked the problem to the next administration like any lazy, incompetent president would.

Also, if Trump manages to get the fat dictator to give up his weapon development, or Trump achieves regime change in N. Korea he should be re-elected on that basis alone."

"3. Hillary, defending an alleged rapist, smears his 12-year-old alleged rape victim, claiming the young girl had a ""tendency to seek out older men."" She also laughs on tape over the cunning way she had vital evidence dismissed, destroying the alleged rape victim's case. 

I have been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing, Hillary wrote in the affidavit about the 12-year-old girl.

There are a variety of perspectives, the majority just doesn't agree with yours. 

Which one do  you want them to have?
Tax the people? 
Tax oil more?
Cut spending?

At 15K per resident spending is too high.  I personally do not want to be taxed when the state spends nearly three times per capita than any other state.

I also don't understand why anyone would want to be taxed to save a savings account. What is the point of a constitutional budget reserve if not to use it now??!!"

"I am not a fan of Caprianno's style but he appears to be searching for the truth,  the facts are the facts and that is what he has reported as far as I can tell , honestly he makes sound arguments about very serious things. Three priests (one died) and a teacher are in jail based on the testimony of Billy Doe.  (I do not claim to know if he was abused or not.) But the facts show that his statements were full of huge contradictions that somehow got through the criminal case and were even worse in depositions for the civil case that was settled. To make it worse the prosecutor shut down a detective who had exculpatory evidence.   As I see it these men should not be in jail.  I believe because of Caprianno the truth is being exposed and I hope that they are quickly given justice and there are serious punishments for the prosecutor for ignoring exculpatory evidence. Doe may have been abused but in this country you must prove you case. He did not even come close."

So, how widespread is that problem? Is it millions of voters? Millions of vote by a few rigging machines and registration? Or, just thousands? I would think that the same people squawking about Russian election meddling might want to know about meddling by an entire DNC/Soros funded operation that is tasked with doing just that. just because Russian meddling doesn't seem to have occurred, is no reason to not think that medddling ocurred. The guy running that fraudulent voter scheme for the DNC met with White House staffers more than 200 times, met with Obama, personally, 47 times. You bet most people want all of that investigated."

"There's a simple test to determine if what you write is true:

Does NCR critique the salaries and finances of other Catholic orgs?

NCR indeed does that, as we can see with its recent crusade on the finances of the K of C.   

Therefore there's no grounds to make a moral appeal that it's somehow wrong for us to ask what NCR is paying its employees.

As for my salary, it isn't tied to donations, nor is it tied to appeals tied to religious belief.  However, the employees at NCR receive income that is directly tied to appeals for donations, and also directly tied to Catholicism.

In my view, this means that NCR is beholden to be straight with its readership and tell them how much it is paying its employees.

Maybe some of these employees are being paid jack, and others are being paid huge six figure salaries.
This very thing happens all over the Catholic media world, I assure you.   Catholic apologist ""stars"" making huge incomes and constantly asking for more $.   We have a right to know."

The vilification of doctors, including by the nurses, and of course in this piece as fat cats is ludicrous.  Doctors work very hard, are very bright and dedicated, and are among the lowest paid Canadians on a talent to compensation basis.

Often too, the monies they receive for the practice that pay for equipment, rent and staff are portrayed as all income. Further, incorporated doctors don't get benefits and pensions and while they can have RSP accounts they pay the full amount and with a $28,500 cap cannot come close to the tax advantaged savings of the civil service who also bear no market risk through DB plans.

In cities like Toronto and Vancouver they do not make enough to live well.

When reporters are the news, make the news, comment with each other about commentaries something is wrong with the entire system.  Being told you are rude which he was, to be quiet which he didn't and allow another reporter to speak all the while saying his network is attacked by Trump is a CNN new low.

"There is much concern about being under the influence of MJ to the extent that it impairs behavior and presents a safety hazard.  Okay, I can agree with that if a person ingests a sufficient amount of it.  But keep in mind that the same applies to alcohol.  In fact, the same applies to a whole host of other ingestible products - including prescription medication.  The point is that MJ in and of itself is fine.  But like any other available, and legal, products, MJ is fine and should be legalized just as alcohol and prescription drugs are.  Sure, have laws in place to limit time/place/quantity/age etc., but criminalizing it is so very silly."

The wall is a bogus issue to make the easily misled think something is being done to help their job situation. It isn't.

The Toronto Sun initially posted the address of Zaynab Khadr in a story when a demonstration was being planned at her home. They did take it down, but this was very ugly.
It's not hard to understand why so many Canadians hate Khadr. Their opinions were formed early in the story when so little was really understood or reported.

"The suburbs already exist. The high-rise buildings with untold numbers of jobs already exist. Sure, you can add 1000s of apartments around the light rail, but that just brings in 1000s more people and 1000s more cars that they leave parked somewhere while they may or may not use the trains. Now, one thing that might help all involved are more shuttle buses from park and rides so that people don't have to drive their cars to the stations."

They're the ones dealing with it and growing with this issue.  So if they aren't complaining then why is everyone else?  I'm pretty sure there's more important concerns facing our state and our country than what someone sees when they look in a mirror, but carry on peanut gallery, carry on."

The legislature (and then Gov. Kitzhaber) also eliminated the timber tax for timber barons in 1999.  

Starving schools of basic funds is a tactic of the conservatives to undermine public schools.  Even David Stockman (Raygun's budget director) has admitted this.

When the University is more concerned about guys from California throwing balls than class size, it's also not a surprise they are in decline.

Religious schools are free to co-exist but not with our tax dollars.  Let them survive on the tuitions that parents give them.

So I agree it would be great to cancel NAFTA, and I would sooner see Canada do it than the US. next Monday am is good enough to pass a law protecting our natural gas, first by making it a Canada first commodity, and than an export commodity at the ""international price"" as stated by Canada. They are wasting Canada gas to feed their power plants and paying Canada less than 30 cents on the buck.

"Putting a temporary ban on people from countries in chaos seems totally reasonable. No one has a right to enter. If Mr Trudeau wants to be really compassionate he could just open the doors with no limits. He won't because it is not in Canada's interest. There are 10 million refugees in the Middle East. They live safely in refugee camps but naturally want to better themselves. It is a bad life. On the other hand ISIS is gradually weakening and is doing its best to infiltrate terrorists into the West. Europe lectures the US while terrorism continues in their own countries. Swarming railway stations to molest women is the latest migrant pastime.

"They were NOT spying on Americans, per se.
They were spying on KNOWN Russian and Chinese spies that Trump's ppl contacted.

"The constitution is based on a principle of the ""rule of law"".  While it has numerous fine-print conditions that seem questionable, it does not (cannot) exclude the right of a formal and unbiased trial, with full defence facilities allowed.  There is a massive difference between ""Guilty as accused"" and ""Guilty because accused by popular opinion"".  A defence lawyer supporting an accused - any accused - is carrying out a constitutionally prescribed duty, regardless of the nature of the charges.
There are no conceivable short-cuts in prosecuting anybody, however guilty he may seem to be.  Otherwise ""justice"" reduces to a show-trial, where a guilty verdict is predetermined, even before any evidence has been led."

I'm sure we'd have plenty of takers there. Free agents, the jury is still out on some of these pickups by other teams, we'll see if they are worth the money.

"I so agree, and while I could not in my wildest dreams vote for Trump.  He was having fun, showing people will believe anything, no matter how far fetched it was.  He was just saying what they wanted to hear, he did not believe it himself.  Will Rogers once said ""A Fool and his Money will be elected"", so Trump proved that right.  Skeeter Davis had a country song and part of it was ""a fool born every minute"", and so look how many fools were born listening to and believing Trump.  Now to stress this point, I did not vote for Clinton, I did vote, but for the first time since I started voting I just never knew the two top runners for President, were not qualified to even clean the White House, let alone live in it."

"Actually the headline is wrong. Winters are warmer NOW and appear warmer than models predicted decades ago. Same thing with glaciers,,,,melting faster than predicted. Tides? Rising faster than predicted. Heavy Rain Events in US..up on average. The scientist were wrong because they didn't think we would warm this fast, though model indicated today's extremes, they deal in averages over time. 

We are sooo... above average. It is too late to slow it, so anything we don't do will make it only worse. 

Fortunately none of scientist were silly enough to think temps would remain stable, follow natural trends, cool,or be related to the Bible. They input current and future levels of made-man greenhouse gasses into their atmospheric models (which are more accurate than ever before) and those are the only chemicals that produce what is happening now. I can do this experiment in the local HS lab for an easy A+., under supervision.

Literature from more centrist or left leaning research institutions suggest that AEI grossly understates that penalty."
"Putting ones finger into a hole in the rapidly flooding waters behind the dike is a short duration fix and doesn't solve the problem.

"Bavius, you should try reading what you post. You're getting further from reality with each one.
Why should anyone need trump out of the country before producing a story on him? Trump would send the Men In Black? And he can't do that except when he's in the USA?  Zeus save us.

""Counter-insurgencies (Army vs insurgents/terrorists, etc.) command a much higher rate of civilian casualties regardless of whether the army belongs to a liberal democracy or an autocracy.""

Of course, we do not expect the MSM to have the intellectual rigor of Mr Taleb. Mr Taleb cannot be bought that cheaply."
"It's true that it's unlikely that any retiree will willingly approve a decrease of their benefits. However, I think you'd be surprised what state workers and retirees might be willing to do for their state once we start plowing through the principal of the PF. Of course there will still be a lot of private sector employees  that got paid more daily and didn't understand why gvmt workers worked for less cash (healthcare and pensions were more important). So, all you'll hear about is what isn't 'fair' and 'they' need cuts. If all gvmt jobs were so awesome and platinum then you'd think everyone would want one. Just a lot of uninformed blather. It doesn't take much to distort what the average income is. Employees getting hired for 700k+ a year sure doesn't help the curve."

Another ignorant post from the far right. Kyle there are MANY reasons why someone does not pay taxes in Alaska such as: being OLD and BROKE. Let's just tax everyone including Maw Kettle who makes $650 a month on Social Security or some kid that has a disability or a person with mental health/ mental retardation issue. You Repubs make me and many Americans wonder about what makes people like you and Kearon among others so bitter against fellow American's.......

"The whole explanation of the medical agreement isn't very enlightening as to what the county is doing.  $50 a month maximum?  Is it $50 or some percentage of salary?  A monthly ""credit"" of $20 for an ANNUAL health screening?  So will the AFSCME employees pay $50 or $30 per month.  And how do they get to do it from pretax dollars?  As a former fed employee my medical insurance premiums were taxed dollars.  Bottom line, the county told the taxpayers all along that its maximum offer was an $8 million package.  What did they settle for?"

"A short story: I was visiting a friend when one of his other friends joined us and immediatedly began an anti-Obama rant.  His first words were ""that stupid N#$%#$"".  I interrupted him and said, ""I don't accept racist slurs in my presence.  If you're going to use them, please let me know and I'll leave and come back to visit Bob later.""  It was a bit awkward, but he got the message.  IMO, we must all confront racist, hateful speech and action when we hear or see it.  Yes, confront it peacefully, but let the actor(s) know we condemn the action.

Passive acceptance is ""tacit agreement.""  If the man uses ""N$#@#$"" in my presence and I say nothing, he can (and likely will) conclude that the term is OK with me.  On a much larger scale, ignoring the celebrations of white supremacy and white nationalism, IMO, constitutes tacit acceptance and agreement.  We must voice our condemnation ""loud and clear.""

"My dear David Leavitt, I love your candor and extraordinary accuracy. I never learned so much about Alaska's North Slope Borough. I fact checked your figures regarding NS Borough taxation and payouts for capital budgets and your scary huge NS Perm Fund.

Those are some mind-blowing facts and figures and you tied them up in such a tight bundle (limit on size on ADN comments post).

You appear to expect that members of the LGBTQ community all belong to some sort of common organization or union of sorts. Maybe it's good for those who oppose their interests that they don't as such an organization would likely represent hundreds of thousands of Canadians. My guess is that the LGBTQ community may well exceed in size the population of Christian fundamentalists in Canada."

"""We can't predict who will kill, but we can get the weapons of mass murder off the street.""
You've stated precisely the crux of what you call ""Our national mass murder problem..."" Throwing up our hands and claiming we can't predict who will kill, is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's unfortunate that an attempt to obtain such information through research was tainted by the biased CDC study.
As I've posted numerous times, attempting to study the causes of ""gun violence"" is misdirection and a misuse of resources. We should be studying the causes of and the telltales of impending violence...all kinds. We need to know with greater certainty than we now have, of what turns a ""normal"" person into a raging mass murderer. With that information available it won't matter how may AR-15s, AK-47s, bazookas, RPGs, IEDs, etc. are on the street.
It's not the weapons . It's the people who use them inappropriately on which we should focus our resources."

"Why is Trudeau anti-American?

Because until he was anointed by the Liberals, his stoned, drop-out life was a succession of failures. He is failure-oriented,-- afraid of success, and will do anything to sabotage practical, workable plans, substituting instead the grandiose, delusional schemes of someone driving on bent rims, with psychological problems.

He knows that he is totally outclasssed by the Donald Trump team in Washington, who might wonder if they'd mistakenly invited a roofer to their meetings,-- he is so ignorant, inarticulate and incompetent.

But at root, Trudeau, the physical bully who shoved MPs around in Parliament,-- is a coward. Someone who picked an easy fight with the deeply-troubled Brazeau.

Perhaps he is also afraid Americans as good neighbors and friends will help us get rid of him,-- representing as he does a Marxist threat on their doorstep, someone only too happy to harbor radical malcontents who could be future sources of unrest."

Were wage and price controls a Conservative idea? In Canada the 1974 election was fought on wage and price controls and the (Progressive) Conservatives supported the policy introduced by their American cousins. Trudeau opposed it.* He changed his mind. I suppose to some people it all make sense if you apply the right label. We may convince ourselves we know what a politician will do but that is a belief and not a certainty.

When you see his name associated with anything it indicates that the deal is crooked - in this case he illegally bypassed the Utility Commission to force a multi-billion dollar project forward despite clear evidence of the wasteful folly of the project. The only time Bennett is not working in the interest of his corporate masters is when he is working in his own interest. Glad to see the back of him."

Sixty-one percent of Americans said the country should stay in the agreement, while just 17 percent supported withdrawing. Another 21 percent said they were unsure.
The ratio reflects the overwhelming support the Paris Agreement has among big players trying to influence the presidents decision. Within the administration, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and familial White House advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump support keeping the U.S. in the deal. Corporate giants, including Walmart, General Mills and DuPont, as well as coal companies and oil majors BP, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell, urged Trump to support the accord. Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, naturally, are on that list, too.""  

Mr. Trump plays to a very narrow base and a withdrawal would not reflect the desires of the American people G Crum"

A few of Ritte's falsehoods: ""... the U.S. military ... in 1893 held Queen Liliuokalani captive in isolation for six months, forcefully took control of ... Iolani Palace and then swiftly proceeded to ... total control of the Hawaiian Islands.""

Truth: 162 U.S. peacekeepers did not take over any buildings, did not patrol the streets, never entered Palace grounds, and never held Lili'uokalani captive. Most returned to their ship as the revolutionary Provisional Government maintained order. 10 weeks later the last troops were gone.

For the next 5 years there were zero U.S. troops in Hawaii. In 1894 the continuing independent nation of Hawaii established its new permanent government. The Republic was officially recognized as the rightful, lawful government by letters of full-fledged diplomatic recognition personally signed by Emperors, Kings, Queens, and Presidents of at least 19 nations on 4 continents in 11 languages, available at

Those ""grow some skin"" comments from, usually 4:20, don't really bother me.  I try to address issues and behaviors which interest or concern me.

Additionally, I also always confront any racist comments made in my presence.  If such behavior makes me ""thin-skinned"" I can certainly live with that.  IMO, those ""grow some skin"" comments are a rather anemic attempt to avoid addressing the issues raised.

   This protest against police shootings of African-Americans should have been done during Obama's presidency; better late than never. Shootings were happening quite frequently several years ago.

Please explain to me the justification for the transfer of this public resource to a handful of individuals for their private benefit. And then please explain why this privatization model should not be applied to timber cutting in the national forests, guiding in national wildlife refuges, vendors in national parks, oil and gas drilling on federal land, or the (mis)management of any public resource.

"Because instead of facilitating employer engagement with the educational sector to align training requirement so Canadians get hired for good paying skilled employment, the government is bending to business lobbyists who don't want to bother, and simply by-pass Canadians and Canadian recent graduates, by bringing in people from abroad. This is not going to help Canadians get jobs which would increase consumer spending. It's going to suppress economic growth, keep debts high, not help Canadian families etc. It's addressing the needs of employers, not the needs of Canadians. Employers are already getting their needs met 10 times over Canadians. The changes are to benefit foreigners and employers. And not Canadians. The whole issue why the economy is not doing well is because Canadians are not being prioritized for good paying jobs, not spending so not driving the economy. That's why we need to substantially lower immigration labor, and foreign workers, internal mobility program workers."

The growth rate in the Lower Mainland right now is actually LOWER than it was when real estate prices and rents were relatively flat 10 and 20 years ago. If you look at pop. growth and housing completion data from the last few years here and consider the average household size, you get a sense that more than enough supply is being built.

"Jeff, I would be more inclined to back that if it taught how to have safe and responsible sex. Abstinence is not reality, not practical and by preaching abstinence, it skips over the entire sex education and teaching kids how to make responsible informed choices. Fact is, your child is more likely to be sexually assaulted and stats are 1 in 4 for on college campus. Teaching abstinence is such a disservice to our youth. You can teach the benefits of abstinence, sure. But preaching no sex? Get real. That's not practical, reality or best for anyone."

The fear of the Church being undone by change only serves to immobilize you and others, in direct opposition to the belief (that you and all Christians share) that Jesus the Christ will never leave us, that He is with us till the end of time.  That means that even in view of the foolish mistakes the men of the Church make repeatedly, the Church will not fail.  But I, personally, do not want to appear before God and not be able to say that I did all I could to help correct those mistakes made in His name.  If it is left to you, as shown in your comment here, nothing would be done because you fear the outcome.  ""Oh ye of so little faith."""

Delusion personified!  The Emperor can do no wrong!  Unbelievable stupidity and false comparison.  The Trumps are using government positions to pursue their own Corporate Billionaire interests on the government dime.  Salaries are chump change to the wealth recovered through their government protections and influence.  Obama put his business affairs into a blind trust.  Der Fuherer refuses to do so.  Obama revealed his tax returns.  Der Fuhrer refuses because it will show no taxes paid for decades based on incompetent business operations leading to multiple bankruptcies.

They'd rather blame everyone else. As for the ""while they try to live their lives and save their communities"" welcome to the real world.  Everyone is trying to live their lives.

David  Macdonald must be a fool for putting forth the analogy of the janitor. The key distinction is that the janitor takes no risks but simply lives off the job that the capital provided by the risk taker provided Mr Macdonald views it as a tax expenditure when the government doesn't provide relief for double taxation. Foreign tax credits make allowance for the fact that foreign income has already been subject to foreign tax as allowed by treaty. The dividend tax credit attempts to integrate the taxes paid by a Canadian corporation when it is distributed with those levied on an individual had they earned the income directly. They operate to prevent both double tax and tax deferral. The half inclusion on capital gains provides some relief from the taxation of inflation that occurs overtime as investors hold investments it also provides some incentive for risk taking for without it the capital businesses need would be substantially reduced. This guy doesn't know what he is talking about

"Terrific piece, and important. Surprised about the negative role of Warren Taylor, who sponsored and passed legislation banning of the death penalty in Alaska in 1959. Gen. Buckner, remembered positively as the military leader in Alaska in WWII, was a southern racist who increased racial barriers in during the war; for example, he barred servicemen from establishments that served Natives, which led to the No Natives signs in Anchorage. As to Gruening, while he may have exaggerated the success of the 1946 act, as the article mentions, he had a huge role--probably the biggest role--in the progress that was made in ending legal racial discrimination in Alaska. He and Muktuk Marston took on Buckner on some of these issues."

2) Rename English Bay as the Black Sea and try to attract tourists from the former Soviet Union.
3)  Build a new container terminal at Fraser  Wharves to expedite the imports of Chinese made steel pipes, valves and structural iron.  Professional seals and rubber stamps of any applicable Canadian standard could be sold there for a nominal $1 fee per 10,000 items imported.  Eases issues with pipeline inspectors.

"I HATE that Trump was elected, but apparently you don't understand how the electoral college works. 

There are 538 electors from the 50 states. That number is based on the number of Representatives for each state (435 total based on state population) + 2 for the 2 senators for each state + 3 for DC. In most states, a electoral college voter CANNOT vote ""against the state majority"" (even if the ""majority"" is only 51% - which means essentially 49% of the state's votes ""didn't count"") without repercussions (in some states civil, in others criminal). That's how a candidate can win the popular vote and still lose the election - and the electoral college voters have very little choice (although the Constitution doesn't ""bind"" them to casting ALL votes the same as the popular majority for that state, the STATES DO)."

"Constitutionality here is a matter of interpretation, one that the courts ultimately decide.

The Trump administration's action rescinding DACA seems to have been calculated to make people play the ""what if"" game.  Indeed, your prediction that Congress will pass some kind of amnesty is predicated on Congress contemplating ""what if"" in an election year.

"Parker, you and your fellow bloviators have compared Trump to Gatsby a million times now.  The comparison is stupid.

Trump was born rich.  Gatsby was born poor and made his money the hard way--by bootlegging. Gatsby served his country in war. Trump boasts about having avoided service. Trump was flashy and attention-seeking from his first breath.  Gatsby is so retiring he doesn't attend even his own extravagant parties.  Trump is crude and insulting.  Gatsby is more gentlemanly than the wealthy men who drink his booze and sneer at him.  He's so idealistic that he intends to take the blame for the accident in place of his beloved Daisy, who was actually driving.

Trump resembles the novel's villain, the born-wealthy brutal Tom Buchanan, much more than he resembles Jay Gatsby.

The Great Gatsby is, by the way, the most overrated American novel of the 20th century.  It became famous mostly because teachers assigned it so their students could grasp certain stereotypes about the Twenties."

She failed to understand that sometimes, black officers shoot white people without just cause, like that case in Louisiana where a white autistic boy was shot by black sheriff. Is that overt act of racism, eh? Police work is a difficult job and often, people who may not be qualified mentally may still wear the uniform. Most of these shooting take place because the officers claims that they ""fear for his/her life"" despite of the fact that there may not be any visible threat. Fear of a threat, is not good enough to kill. There got to be a clear threat. In all three shooting, it was the fear that triggered the shots. This does make you wonder if some of the police officers are too fearful of a personality to do their job? After all, most Marines will run toward the fire, but the few will go the opposite way."

"I do not care if this ""single payer"" plan is a clever ruse to destroy Democrats; which should be destroyed as they have become some foreign Marxist Party.  Republicans should never even bring up the idea of this failed system.  All those progressive countries with single payer have  failures to show for their compassion.  Socialism has not worked in the past; is not working now & will not work in the future.  Only Capitalism works; which most members of Congress do not understand, because they are ignorant fools.  Further, people forget that Socialism destroys the jobs that could have been; opportunities that could have been; & a future that could have been."

And their political candidates find them such easy marks, cynically exploiting that fear.  
But what a pathetic, desolate way to live."

The media are clearly working together to destroy Trump and elect Clinton , even more so then when they worked together to elect Obama.  Note yesterday how a GOP office was firebombed . Firebombed ! Yet the story appeared on page three in a tiny story listed only under "" election notes "" . Had it been a democratic office that had been firebombed the press would have screamed bloody murder louder than Watergate . Obama and Lynch would already have the justice department on the scene ."

Third World country term is designated to a country not directly aligned with the West or the Soviet Union after World War II. I think the term you are searching is a developing country and the world gets better when a poor country starts to develop. The develoment of a country brings opportunity to everyone just focusing on the manufacture sector is wrong.

"I don't care what the people think about the transition. It's going to happen no matter what they think.  I've been around long enough to see how people have manipulated data to know that there are some that will twist that data to meet their agenda.  It's a shame that good people that truly want honest results have to be lumped in with the manipulators.  I stand by my statement. Anyone that buys what they are told without skepticism are fools.  Ignorance can be taught, fools can too but they have to acknowledge they are fools before they can change their thought process.  Not too many people can admit they were fools.  Okay, maybe a little harsh.  Let's change that to naive."
"There is nothing you are saying that involves creating laws that say others have to live by your religious views, so seems like we aren't disagreeing.

I'm pretty sure you have to stop serving everyone, since we all are with sin."

"Well said. These types have managed to link the 'crony capitalism' evident in most commie (or quasi-commie  like Russia today, or SA? ) states with the 'real' capitalism that has made the Free World into the huge success it has been and generally continues to be - as long as it can my keep the politicians out of it - over the last few centuries. Suttner is obviously still trying to do this - it must hurt like hell to see yet another darling of the revolution go the same way as all the others."
It's all the fault of Christian Crusaders in the 12th Century and Donald Trump.  I await for our political and cultural overlords to tell us it had nothing to do with Islam.
"You make it sound simple, but where would that line be drawn? Be specific.

If you think it would ban semi-automatic rifles, or handguns (both of which were found in the attacker's hotel room), then you're overlooking their numerous civilian uses: hunting, home defence, pest control, sport, etc.

If you were just thinking of banning machine guns, then you're in luck: fully automatic weapons are already tightly restricted by US federal law. But it's not clear at this point that the attacker actually used any such weapons. He may instead have made modifications or used accessories to enable quicker firing, but that has not been confirmed. If he did convert a semi-auto weapon to fully automatic fire, that would've been illegal too.

What I'm saying is, there's no easy fix here. Either the line was already drawn (and didn't stop this massacre), or it would have be drawn in a place that would turn legitimate civilian users into criminals."
That would be great and solve a lot of problems in Alaska.

Your last line sums up you confusion. So USA coal killls 200k people a year (zero facts/figurs/explanations etc) and presumably the other coal countries (bigger and smaller plus SA) coal does not kill people?.

"Yes, yes and yes! I completely agree that HPD should be publicly accountable for their actions. But it troubles me that the Chief Prosecutor, Keith Kaneshiro is sitting idly aside defending his employee, Kathrine Kealoha. Kaneshiro continues to play the role of ""Defense Attorney"" when it comes to ""Kathy."" Like Chief Kealoha, Kaneshiro is arrogant and dirty! He refuses to cooperate with the Feds and continues to make statements like, ""Kathy has committed no crime under the law."" Sounds like Kaneshiro's years as a defense attorney is paying off! I hope the Feds turn their attention to the Prosecutor's office with the same vigor as they are giving to HPD. 

The Prosecutor's Office should be publicly accountable for their own actions. Since 2011 the office has failed miserably in trying high profile cases (State vs. Deedy). The Appellant Court has overturned murder convictions (State vs. Collins) due to prosecutor misconduct and the list goes on. Is Mr. Kaneshiro above the law too?"
""" Putin can also act to damage the Trump presidency, or blackmail it,""

That depends on what his hackers find/found, actually, doesn't it? 

We know that Podesta/Hillary were too stupid or too arrogant to keep that dirty laundry hidden.

You and your ilk make it sound like she lost to Mickey Mouse. Mike Tyson lost a couple of professional fights. Are you suggesting that because he lost he sucks and you could have beat him? There is no shame in losing to Obama. And there's no shame in losing to Trump, when one considers that most people are simpletons and he got the simpleton vote."

"I wish Tim had gone into a bit more detail about eligible and ineligible dividends, as the article kind of gives the impression that you can just pay yourself in dividends instead of salary, tax free up to 50K a year, depending on your province. 
This is true of eligible dividends, but not ineligible dividends, which have a less favorable tax treatment. In my (admittedly limited) understanding, in order for a dividend to be eligible, it has to have a) come from eligible dividends paid to the corporation from investments (shares it owns of other corporations) or b) from income over the 500K limit. So if you own a smaller company hoping to pay yourself just in eligible dividends, you are SOL. 
Capital gains in corporations are taxed at close to 50%, even under 500K, so they really aren't the ideal vehicle to hold shares in."

"You took the words right out of my mouth. This is a so-called ""analysis"" which reads as fairly critical of the Avs for buying Beauchemin out, without ever acknowledging the primary reason WHY they bought him out. It was all about the expansion draft. I'm sure Sakic knows that Beach could have contributed in some role this season, but a team that is trying to get younger and faster simply does not protect a 37yo ""third pairing mentor"" in an expansion draft at the expense of younger players.

For Beauchemin's sake, I'm glad he gets a chance to play this season with a team and a city he's familiar with, rather than ending his career getting bought out (although getting paid $3m to golf all winter would have taken some of that sting away, I'd bet). But for the Avalanche, buying him out was 100% the right thing to do for the team. I would disagree with an analysis that reached a different conclusion, but an analysis that fails to even mention the expansion draft is ridiculous."
"You have repeatedly claimed this situation of extreme famine continued for ""sis year, 6 months"" as you clearly stated. It did not. The current extreme famine dates to March, 2015, and I have provided two credible sources with links to prove that.

Just as Somalia, the Horn of Africa, and South Sudan have had periodic food shortages including famine off and on for decades, so has Yemen. But the current famine in Yemen is extreme, and my link to the photos that accompany this article in The New York Times will give you an idea how outrageous a war crime, as Nicholas Kristoff puts it, this situation is. This Yemen famine is extreme and was deliberately engineered by Saudi Arabia to starve Yemen into submission.

You would dearly love to blame Obama for this, but in fact it hasn't developoed to its current state until recently, since Trump kissed the king's ring and promised the Saudis all the weapons of their dreams.

Only Trump can stop this famine. This is Trump's war. He bought it."

This is the cheapest possible little gasline from Deadhorse to Livengood, 
I originally sketched it out in Tommy's Elbow Room in 1974, and this updated version is about 20 years old.

We can shorten it by 140mi if we get to use the idle 10"" fuelgasline that runs between Deadhorse and PS4-Galbraith.

GASFLOW = CASHFLOW

If we get the tiniest bit of gas flowing our direction we can make it grow into a statewide SuperGrid gas and power transport network.

This little noodlepipe will make Andree McLeod jump for joy  ;-p

Dirty wet field-gas NGL's can be profitably shipped in a funky little HDPE pipe like this. A HDPE-flexpipe shipping unprocessed gas can be defined as a ASTM/API gas-gathering pipe if we use it to transfer the raw-condensate to Nenana for re-injection, like CINGSA."

Pregame and half-time entertainment has more or less abandoned the fan base (in the CFL and NFL) by relying primarily on performers that would barely register outside of their core demographic.   Trying to sell football games on premise of come for the half time concert and stay for the game only goes so far with those you are trying to attract and does little to encourage your core to want to renew their tickets.  Not to mention the economic realities of which demographic has the disposable cash to spend on football games and which demographic would sooner spend on actual concerts."

"1/2 Gaudium et Spes, Ch 1, But in their manner of acting, spouses should be aware that they cannot proceed arbitrarily, but must always be governed according to a conscience dutifully conformed to the divine law itself, and should be submissive toward the Church's teaching office, which authentically interprets that law in the light of the Gospel.

Gaudium et Spes, 16,  .... Conscience frequently errs from invincible ignorance without losing its dignity. The same cannot be said for a man who cares but little for truth and goodness, or for a conscience which by degrees grows practically sightless as a result of habitual sin."

"Trump is a racist, and many people who voted for Trump are racists. That's a fact that has been borne out by numerous studies, surveys and polls, in addition to brazen admissions by white supremacists in the Trump base.

Governments should be concerned for economic reasons as well. We simply can't afford to have millions more people developing diabetes and heart disease."

Seems like a hit below the belt delivered by the G&M and it shows how G&M has lost its way from journalism to mouthpiece.  

Does G&M have any disagreement with outcome of electoral reform or new tax rules as they are today?  If so, then that is what I would expect in an editorial, along with specific concerns/suggestions.  Not some smear piece or rant.  It is cynical that the G&M and Conservatives support the current FPTP, then G&M complains when the Liberals concluded that no change is also the best option for n.  Liberals made tax changes in response to public input.  Would G&M prefer no change be made to tax?"

"I don't know which is more astounding, the degree to which Ms. Monsef demonstrates that she is unqualified for her cabinet position, or the minority report from the NDP/Green contingent.

The evidence for the necessity of change is overwhelming; the evidence for the necessity of holding a referendum is not.  Their first assertion is debatable, but that these parliamentarians suggest in the second phrase that Canadians have no need to approve of a fundamental change to our electoral system is astonishing.  How can a parliamentarian actually believe they have the right to unilaterally change the basic form of our electoral system - without the express consent of the electorate?  It is as fundamental a change as a government deciding we are switching to being a republic rather than a constitutional monarchy.  No government has the right to unilaterally change the structure of our democracy without the consent of Canadians asked for and received."
"Is anyone surprised that it was the Republican party that foisted their less-than-fit candidate upon the nation? They've been extremists for a long time. Their choice in Trump reveals they'd put anybody in the office as long as he was willing to undertake their extremist agenda. Trump is the epitome of today's racist Republicans. His agenda is the summation of what Republicans stood for for decades. First and foremost, they are women-haters and racists. Now they've exposed themselves as neo-Nazis to boot."

"Trump is a life-long racist who ran an openly racist campaign for president.  I think I was as aware of anyone of how unqualified he was and is: ""uniquely unqualified"" is how I described him many times, referencing his unique combination of arrogance, ignorance, bigotry, corruption, incompetence and emotional instability.  But even I am surprised by how much damage this man has done, and how quickly, to the United States, its people, its Constitution and its values.  Even two years ago, I could not have conceived that Nazis bearing swastikas and saluting in the Nazi style and Klansmen wearing robes would slither out from under their rocks, marching loudly and proudly, and thanking the President of the United States because they recognize and embrace him as one of their own. Tragic. Deplorable, Despicable."

"Yes, white people are responsible for the privilege we carry, part of which is due to oppression of other races. Similarly, heterosexual people are responsible for the privilege they carry, part of which results from placing themselves on pedestals they deny to other loves.

As for my knowledge of Christianity, I am a Christian. I'm simply not an Evangelical, which is a modern, Western, anti-intellectual sect, which tends to idolize the Bible as some form of Cosmic Rule Book, rather than actually practice Christ's commandment to love God and neighbor. Having been at the receiving end of Evangelical political hostility for 30 years - right here in Portland - I'm speaking from experience.

If Imago Dei doesn't want to be identified with its Conservative Baptist brethren, it should disassociate from that denomination, and treat women and LGBTQ people as equals. Until it does ... it can expect to be treated like any other right-wing church. Tattoos cover skin, not hardened hearts."

Similarly, when I said that your equating practising homosexuals with blacks was tantamount to accusing the latter of being sinners, you never responded.
I have also noticed that you don't seem to pick up nuances in comments; if one is not for something then you automatically assume they are against it. When posters try to explain you have no time for subtle difference and nuanced arguments. You just label them all liars."

"There are two different issues here.  (1) Law: what private activity is regulated and what private activity is not regulated.  Govt cannot interfere with any private activity unless the law is clear as to the exact activity regulated.  (2) Law: the DOH failing its duty to regulate thereby violating rights of due process, equal protection, and/or privacy.   Furthermore, govt must ably and fairly, in fact, regulate or else violate constitutional protections due private activities.  So, before reaching your conclusions, be careful to not presume interpretations of legislated statutes and, too, an agency's consequential administrative regulations.  Keep in mind that judges aren't as competent or relevantly experienced as you'd think.  If they were, they wouldn't be judges."

A Trooper could not have been in a coercive relationship with an AAG, she far out-ranked him.

I have to disagree though with the idea that Trumpism is somehow any different from old school conservative-style scapegoating, but for the veneer of brass and marble and bad hair. I see the same mentality as usual: Blame the worlds problems on society's weakest members and then rush to claim the mantle of victimhood when confronted in any way for having terrible ideas and hair.

We are ordered to a principle that this nation is not a numbers game, of how many of any category be, but that individuals have a minority right of dissent not to be prevailed upon by a majority.

"The Hawai'i-based longliners takes 5% percent of their catch from the proposed expansion area. The rest comes from the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone around the Main Hawaiian Islands and from international waters.  They are already competing with foreign fishers in international waters. 

No significant changes are anticipated with expansion. The longliners will continue to take as many fish as possible until they reach the quota for bigeye tuna. Then they will purchase quotas from Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa and continue fishing in federal waters around Hawai'i. (Such a deaI!)

The longliners will continue exporting to Asia and the mainland. Prices will fluctuate based on supply and demand like other products/commodities. Retailers will continue to raise ahi prices around Christmas and New Years because they know we will buy. Retailers will continue to sell poke made with the frozen foreign fish treated with carbon monoxide. 

No worries!"

"Actually, there are many that are wealthier than Trump and that are more self-made than he is (Trump did start with a $1 million check from daddy), and I have zero problem with them.  Many of them have never filed for bankruptcy.....or admitted to groping women.....or cheated on their wives.....or are as ignorant.

Trump and Mark Cuban are about equal in net worth (with Trump a hair higher...both in $3.5 billion range).  Cuban's dad was an automobile upholsterer, and his mom worked a variety of odd jobs.  Pretty sure he didn't get a $1 million check from dad.  Trump thinks he hit an HR when he was born on 3rd base."
"All Hawaii housing is negatively impacted by illegal vacation rentals. As Hawaii's affordable housing experts Victor Geminiani, Reverend Bob Nakata and Rene Berthiaume stated in a recent editorial; ""In tight housing markets with low vacancy rates, any reduction in supply naturally increases rents, particularly because neither the market nor the public sector can quickly add to housing stock. Airbnb indirectly reduces the affordable housing supply by reducing the overall housing supply of units available for long-term rentals."""

Today, we need to replace ""George Bush"" with ""Donald Trump.""( if there was room, we could add the names of the entire GOP Congressional leadership.}  Trump was born rich and has devoted his entire life to getting richer.  That's fine.....it's his choice.  However, study his business history, his personal history and his political history.  He has consistently disregarded the welfare of others for his personal gain...IMO, he's the personification of ""To hell with you, I've got mine.""

"[You did not deny my contention]
Let me get this straight.  I am under some burden to address something completely speculative or else it is considered as accurate or even valid?  Go read about Russell's Teapot as you are sorely ignorant of basic logic.
[Actually I have intimate knowledge of what I speak]
Then it should be easy for you to provide a source that supports what you speak of.  So why didn't you?  Do you believe everyone else is supposed to believe you simply because you say so?  Did your mother ever teach you not believe everything you hear, read, etc. because you seem to function in completely the opposite.

"Gerson helped build the republican party into exactly what it is today...a fever swamp of bigotry and ignorance. Now that he's finally noticed the toxic waste dump he spent 35 years helping to create, he claims to be above it all and anybody who doesn't agree with him is a hyper-partisan. See...it's not lifelong republican Gerson's fault that modern conservatism is a rolling dumpster fire, it the fault of those ""other"" republicans over there. 

Put a sock in it, Gerson. You helped create the toxic waste dump and no amount of both siderist horsepucky will ever clean the stink off."

last year the Argos averaged ~16,500 per game which was by far the lowest attendance in the league despite the fact that Toronto is by far the largest population centre in Canada--the bottom line is nobody (especially the millennial crowd) have no interest in the CFL/Argos.

The Broncos sucked on both sides of the ball Sunday night.  It was embarrassing.
"Hosting any senior official from ex-community organizer Barack Obamas failed War Party administration would be stupid with Donald Trump about to take office. Hosting the buffoonish, ignorant  Joe Biden is particularly puzzling. Why favour the fanboy of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which engineered the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Roma in Kosovo with NATO help? Biden gave a speech to an audience of Albanian-Americans that highlighted the Battle of Pristina in 1388. (He actually meant the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the most famous battle in Serbian history. It was like he called the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by another name and thought it was fought in 1065.) However Trudeau likely  sees in a politician who is ignorant and buffoonish a kindred spirit."
"That's a choice.  But, CU is one of the finest universities in the land.  And, this has nothing to do with CU.  It is a bunch of dumb white kids from out of town trying to stir up trouble.  Is CU a liberal school - perhaps. But, it is also a school that produces many incredible people - see e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_University_of_Colorado_Boulder_alumni Don't dog CU because of some misconceived illusion of of CU being in a liberal town."

"These numbers are pathetic. Democrats need to wake up and quit towing the party line during elections. It is clear your ""solutions"" and ""common sense"" are failing the children in this state."
"Look no further than than ethics of the press if you want to establish how politicians have been allowed to become so unprincipled.  I have seen members of the press embracing lying and labeling it as clever. Example, a politician campaigns to the left during a primary and then changes their rhetoric to a more centrist bent for the general. In my mind this exposes a lack of core principles with the exception of having the principle of saying anything to get elected. Misleading statements and statements that are intentionally intended to misrepresent a politicians belief is NOT clever; but instead, it is lying.  Why is it so hard for the media/press to point out the lies instead of giving praise for running an effective campaign?  Words like pivot are used instead calling a lie a lie. For anyone to embrace and accept this type lying behavior as clever has lost their own moral compass."
"So if something costs less than $500 it must be a necessity?  I don't think so.  I know people who are so stupid they think the entire family from age 8 needs to have new cell phones, ipads and laptops, but they borrowed $$ to buy groceries.  The dollar value has nothing to do with whether or not an item is needed for a person's life so consumer taxes are GOOD.  As for taxing us more through income tax?  BAD idea.  This country, like many families, does NOT have a revenue problem.  They have a spending problem.  CUT the damned spending."
"Most people evidently subscribe to the fool or idiot category !

"Joe Dick:
""What's the next pathetic liberal excuse for losing an election badly?""

-

That liberal bogeyman sure is handy!

Not only has he infected the media, a majority of America's voting population, independents and partisans on both sides of the aisle, foreigners, corporations, musicians, unpaid contractors, Miss Universe contestants, Trump university students, a majority of world polls, etc. But it seems he now controls the entire intelligence community as well (even Comey, the ""liberal"" with his finger on the scales).

And all so that you, Joe Dick, dont have to consider a single bad word about your boy.

That just happens to be really great for private prison companies! Time to expand!

I suspect people are smart enough to check their workplace drug use policies before indulging. I personally have never worked in a place that had drug testing.

"This is about the stupidest law suit in a long time. The author has it correct that you really do not know why a person is elected. You can surmise, but you just don't know. All the GOP in the district could have voted for the Dems and all the Dems could have voted for the GOP, you have no idea.....IF you believe we truly have secret ballots.

But there is another point that should end this lawsuit immediately: there is no mention nor any place for political parties in our constitution and our system of government, period. So what is a partisan other than someone who strongly supports an irrelevant association when it comes to governing and the constitution. What next gerrymander to make sure the requisite number of blue eyed people are in each district? That there is the requisite number of Asians in each district? Gerrymander so that all libertarians are in a district so they get representation? All greens?"

We will be done with cult orange in less than two weeks. The evangelicals have proven their hypocrisy. Our country allows the religious great freedom by constitution.

"Lynn Willis - In another comment in this thread, I stated that ""nobody"" was used in the context of a generalization. The statement ""Nobody in the South regretted the passing of slavery"" is a quote from a book by someone who lived through the war and Reconstruction, although I've read the same in several places. I believe the book was the ""The South was Right"" written by James Kennedy. Maybe you can find it on the internet. I knew well and have spoken to dozens of people in the South born between 1863 and 1900, the oldest born a slave, the others, sons and daughters of Confederate veterans and slaves. These people recounted theirs and their parents' views and understanding of slavery, and none of them had or reported regret at the demise of slavery. Obviously, slaves wouldn't regret the passing of slavery, I didn't say they did. I don't know how you arrived at that.

Due to limitations in space, I'll address the other part of your comment in sequence."
"I find it incredible how media such as yours uses words like ""plummet"".  I would hardly call a 1.6% decline a ""plummet"".  It's interesting how when the markets go up 1.6%, the words used are, The market gained 1.6% today.  Media sells papers by using dramatic words to scare people.  Incidentally, the DOW is down 1.63% as a write my post from its ALL TIME high.  Further, it is up 9.63% since Trump was elected on November 8th.  That is over 6 months.

As mentioned, for all the insanity of his personal behavior the generals and Rex Tillerson are doing a good job in foreign policy. Finally America has taken a stand against North Korea, Pakistan and Russia. The concept that Trump is pro Putin is ridiculous. He has been putting a finger in Putin's eye for months. The generals are being allowed to fight the wars instead of minor decisions being made by White House politicos. 

What is being obscured by his madness is the misbehavior of groups like Antifa, basically a terrorist group against free speech, and Southern Poverty Leadership,  a group dedicated to smearing anyone who disagrees with them. Watch for the masks."

Putting in a new guy if these Broncos do good in place of Siemian will become an even bigger long-shot.  And, if Siemian and the offense does bad, I could see Elway not taking a chance and going after one of the big name QB's that enter free agency next year."

"Y'know, if Trump were actually smart, he would take advantage of this situation this way:
1.  Fire Bannon and that Gorka creature who's been talking from the WH;
2.  During the ""announcement press conference"", say the following:  ""I tried listening to Bannon and his people.  The more I learned, and the more I've seen, I realize how disgusting and dangerous they are.  I was in bed with them.  I've gotten out of the bed.  It stinks.""
3.  Openly direct the AG to pursue investigations of not only the Charlottesville incident, but the general activities of all identifiable White Supremacy groups.
4.  Speak out against any rallies by White Supremacy groups, and order an FBI presence at each.

Trump could actually romance the left by doing this. 

The left would accept out of a desire and sense of relief.

It's a no loss proposition for him.  Sticking with the White Supremacist movement is a loser.  A YUGE LOSER!"

"The Church's view on women and children makes sense:  Don't have sex until you get married.

Before the good ol' feminists let women who stayed at home to raise their kids know how oppressed they were, maternity leave wasn't an issue, single motherhood wasn't something to be proud of, and abortion wasn't a common procedure.

If anyone's rights were violated, it was the officers' when the crowd tried to prevent them from doing their jobs."

"Trump is an intellectual and moral cretin.  The only things that mean anything to him are money and his ego.  Expecting intelligent leadership or moral vision from him are like, well, expecting the tide not to roll in.  In 2018 and 2020 we need to elect better leaders.  In the meantime, we need to be loud and shrill that we are not going to let him walk over us."

"I'm not excusing the Right's treatment of Obama, it was absurdly disgusting. But we cannot excuse one's moral actions with that of another. I'm saying on issues like this, we should be comparing if Trump has a better approval rating than the previous couple presidents, rather than a false equivalency between Trump and Clinton (which the right can always win, because Clinton was never President). If we hold Trump accountable to the standards of other Presidents, that is a fight that the left can win."
Here's an idea: why are we even still staying the stupid Pledge of Allegiance? It's pointless and jingoistic.

Just look at Al Gore's inconvenient truth - his models are an embarrassment to science and have been completely discounted but he was still a keynote speaker in Paris. And what about the hockey stick graph on temperatures, well that didn't come true so we call it climate change instead of global warming. A UN bureaucrat looking for more authority under the guise of saving the earth, pretending to subscribe to a higher moral authority the rest of us average plebs don't understand - especially those in Ontario who should suck it up instead of whining over their power bills - think of the children!"

Christians err when, in place of not knowing, they create an unbelievable, illogical, untestable explanation.  Atheists don't ""do whatever you want as long as the law doesn't catch you"". We, like any other human, respond to all the governmental laws, social norms, lessons learned etc. These rules are man made just like those in the bible written under the guise of supernatural authorship. Most humans desire to be lied to, demand it and crave it. Evidence for that is religion with its promise of eternal life and the campaign of Donald Trump."

"Canada in the post-world war 2 era has never been and will never be fertile ground for the sort of harsh libertarianism being proposed by the likely leadership race winner, Maxime Bernier. 

It's a delusional political philosophy that draws its inspiration from a fanciful historical view of the late 1800s and early 1900s, where it is alleged that hard-working and resourceful men (yes, all men) were free from the shackles of big government to pursue their destiny while the unwashed masses wallowed in poverty brought on by their own laziness. 

In reality, the wealthy were largely born wealthy and the poor were born poor, with few opportunities for the latter to improve their station. Greater government involvement in prudently regulating economy and enhancing social well-being in the latter half of the 20th century were critical to establishing the civilized and relatively fair country we live in today. Calls for returning to the dog-eat-dog days of the 1920s will not succeed."
"Just to-day in another paper there is a call on Elections Canada to investigate foreign interference in Canada's last election in order to defeat the Conservative Party, and wouldn't you know it, the interference came from U.S. organizations? This was enough to tip the vote against the Conservative candidates  in several ridings, and almost definitely accounted for the defeat of the Conservative government and installation of the Liberal government. Meanwhile, somehow we are fascinated by the possibility of getting rid of the Trump presidency by hook or by crook, and if that doesn't work, failure to hold hands at airports. Mr. Trump is apparently treating the heads of federal agencies as if they were his employees; it's a hard habit to break. Let us pray that his fiscal policies see the light of day to make America Great Again. And as for treating the Russians as if the cold war is still on, that is institutional paranoia that is not productive; better friends than enemies."

"Don't get me started. I think it was very brave of Premier Wynne to say no (BTW I am not a supporter). She knew there would be blow back but understood that this was primarily a tax on people in other communities to subsidize low property taxes in Toronto.

I live in Markham and have the privilege of paying 20% higher property taxes than Torontonians and pay hundreds of dollars a month for 407 tolls and I get to see much of my provincial income tax go to support funding for Toronto.

My only complaint for of the Premier on this issue is she didn't tell the Mayor to ""suck it up buttercup"" earlier.

The federal and provincial governments are contributing generously to the Mayor's ""Smart Track"" plan. He is now trying to unload Toronto's portion on the backs of commuters. Shame. Torontonians need to pay their share."
Very good.
"Did you see this headline on the CBC site? 
""Syrians call Trump's expected plan to ban refugees dangerous, stupid""
I didn't bother reading it. It is not news that refugees don't support a ban on refugees. It is not news that umbrella salespeople support rain. Did the intrepid CBC reporter expect refugees to be supportive? Is it in fact, the reporter who holds these views and needed to get a Syrian to say it to be able to write it. Did the reporter seek out an opinion to support their own bias?"
Who will fill these posts that are so important?   Anyone who's really qualified and interested in serving the nation would be turned down by Trump's lackeys in favor of more like themselves.   The lunatics have indeed taken over the asylum.

"Exactly. Look at Ontario: we now have a carbon tax, a high corporate tax rate (assuming Trump cuts the U.S. rate to 15% as promised), and ridiculously high hydro rates. What is the incentive for business to stay here vs. the U.S.? Especially, if NAFTA is not altered in a way that will negatively impact our businesses."
"Obama voiced his opinion on criminal cases that were causing a great deal of turmoil in the communities those crimes happened in.  He also echoed concern for people of color seemingly being treated unfairly in some of those cases.  The things Obama spoke out on, were current events that needed a Presidents attention in at least acknowledging that people were upset and that he was aware of their issues.  There was (and still is) the very real issue of police relations with these communities.  Did Obama ever suggest a business should fire its employees for not doing something he disagreed with?  Did Obama ever try and dictate how a business should be run? 

Trump on the other hand rehashed an old controversy, for no real apparent reason other than he has the inability to control anything he says because he has the impulse control of a toddler.  Trump will say whatever is on his mind without a single thought of how it might impact anyone else."
Trump is miscalculating. He counts on Russian to support him but he can't pay the Russian price. Why Russian do his bidding without getting real concession from him?
So our unpensioned professionals will just leave the country like in the mid 90's and all the seniors who want the government to tax more for their goodies can wait in line 5x longer to see a doctor.  What idiot MBA thought this one up.

"Sadly the author doesn't see the bigger picture by asking, who would be best for America, not Alaska.

Over the last year, tRump has said at least 10 times, ""I'm the most militaristic person"". With tRump at the helm appeasing the neocons, there would likely be new wars in the middle east with Iran and Saudi Arabia and much higher oil prices. That would probably be good for the U.S. oil production and our budget, but very bad for America.

Why are some like this author so short sighted when it comes to national security and WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA? Don't vote for Trump and incite the rest of the world to hate America again. Voting for POTUS is usually a case of choosing the devil we know vs. the devil we don't know. Or in this election, voting for the least crazy, Billary."

The church continues to use the Bible as the basis [and then any church teaching supposedly based on the Bible] as the main proof for the church's argument against homosexual acts.  

The church tried to use the Bible, centuries before to prove that Galileo was wrong in his assertions---that the sun is the center of the solar system.  The Bible was not written to be a 'proof' text to support that the earth is the center of the solar system, then.  And the Bible is not a 'proof' text to support that either being a Gay or to engage in homosexual acts is sinful now.

The church either needs to use forensic medical science to prove its points.  If it can't, the official church needs to stop making a fool of itself."

"Children are not children until they are born.  Women end pregnancies.
Abortion is not murder.  Please refer to endingawantedpregnancydotcom and you will read tragic cases that the right wing will never acknowledge.
If you believe that pregnancies resulting from rape should continue to birth, then you believe in another form of slavery for women. Women have the basic human right to choose the father of their future children and select the best timing.   I feel very confident that Jesus is more understanding and has more empathy than ultra pious men do."
The stupidity and arrogance of U.S. foreign policy is indeed exceptional.

Don't let the news play with your emotions."
"Oh, so you think a degree gives you intelligence?    I know exactly what you said and it is perfectly understood.   It's what the KKK has been saying since the civil rights movement.  If you agree with glorifying a racist history, then you're a racist.  (BTW -  hopefully you remember all your homophobic rants about transgender soldiers).   MAGAphants and Fox lapdogs like you would love to rewrite the horror of the Civil War into some noble cause.  Of course, as a true lover of KKK and alt-right ideology, you'd probably love if Germany still had statues of Himler, Goering, Spier, and Hitler standing in their town squares.   One more point.  There's a reason Abraham Lincoln surrounded Lee's house in Virginia with the northern war dead. Because Lee was a hateful and willing participant in a treasonous racist movement that cost this country 500,000 lives.  In case you don't know that cemetery is Arlington national cemetery and surrounds Lee's mansion.  You moron."
"This article does a poor job of presenting this subject. First, it portrays the laicized deacon as rather clueless: ""I didn't give it a second thought."" If this is a fair portrayal, then it calls into question (a) the deacon's own judgment and seriousness about the vocation he embraced, and (b) the deacon's formation.

Second, the article fails almost entirely to present the theological, historical and ecumenical context of this. It has always, always been the case, for East and West, that having received Holy Orders, marriage was impossible. It is woven into how the Church, from the beginning, has understood the nature of the vocation to holy orders -- it involves a radical ""leaving behind."" For this reason, in my diocese, married men who become deacons must greatly involve their wives in the discernment.

Finally, this illustrates how much of the talk about married priests presents false hope. It's a new set of problems replacing old ones."

"I watched video of Trump's Nashville rally as he discussed his travel ban before the crowd. Trump said the president could ban whoever and whenever ""he or she wants - but not Hillary"". Trump paused and looked at the crowd, who started chanting ""lock her up! lock her up!"" That's proof to anyone with a somewhat open mind. Some people, however, will say their own eyes lie if it displeases them.

Trump has his followers well trained. He cued those chants all last year during his campaign. You can tell yourself whatever you like, but Trump does this deliberately, and his crowd always responds. Of course, by now most of us know there is nothing that Hillary can be locked up for. All the accusations were phony. Hillary Clinton is about as honest as any politician, and more than most.

I take note of your accusation against me. I know to expect the worst from you, Tired, and you haven't let me down this time. Have a nice day."

"Having guided in the same areas as the Wilderness Explorer the  guides and expedition leaders made critical errors in judgment years ago.  They should have never ventured into Sitkoh Creek at this time of year.  Dozens of brown bears visit Sitkoh Creek to feed on sockeye, pink, chum and coho salmon.  There is a virtual bear highway shouldering both sides of Sitkoh Creek.  That with rolling terrain, dense foliage and a roaring creek made for a unfortunate mauling.  There is tremendous pressure put on there guides to show clients brown bears, but at what cost.  I warned the expedition leaders to curtail the tours and behavior of there clients which are very affluent and perhaps difficult to manage.  Unfortunately I don't believe the Wilderness Explorer and sister ship, Surf Bird will change there tours or there behaviors.  

All the best to there guides which unfortunately were mauled."
"While we do have the right to protest ,it is important not to judge anyone on what we think , or more
precisely , fear that they may do.Also, it would be worthwhile to consider how Trump has come to be perceived as a threat.One way or the other we should avoid knee jerk reactions.Trump may be obnoxious, abrasive and , above all , boastful , but he is realistically nowhere near as bad as his detractors make him out to be nor as great as he claims to be."

"Amen and Amen - Bullying is intentional and repetitive.  These guys were stupid for sure, but should have been given a chance to speak with student body and parents in an open forum.

I have news for  them, and I tell my kids this all the time, people are going to speak evil about you, what do you do ? Dwell on it ? No, you forgive and move on, which has been my position with Trump as well (garycrum) from day one. The guy has done some stupid things for sure, but give him a chance to rise to the equation and forgive him. This episode is not helping these kids at all, and is teaching them no lessons that will help them later on. I think it is a pathetic example of an angry vengeful society."

"Jessica, You posted exactly what I was about to post ...  Yes, Graf crying that ASD needs money.  Then 6 months later finding 22 million behind the sofa cushions.  That undermines trust in the ASD.  And when the ASD says the need 50 million for school repairs, how do we know that is the truth?  The ASD does not clarify how the bond amount was determined.  The ASD doesn't offer verification that the bond amount was the result of a bidding process.  Or just a guess by administrators.  The ASD doesn't tell us what percentage of the bond funds was used for the repairs, what amount of the bond was used for ASD administrative overhead, what wasn't used and where the unused money went.  Based on the last 30 years of building Comeau Castle schools and burning billions to produce dumber and dumber kids, I don't think the ASD can ever be trusted."

I don't share your pessimism.  Our kids are just as bright; our teachers are just as dedicated and our parents are just as loving and involved as anywhere else. 

It's the public school system status quo that's broken in Alaska. Without major reform and a competitive spur, more funding will just create a more expensive failure."

That's just like funding the CASA program because DHS is supposed to take care of foster kids and doesn't. We need to clean house of incompetent administrators and employees, and then hold these tax funded agencies accountable for doing their jobs. Creating individual city level DEQs is duplicative and wasteful, and seems to assume the state DEQ can never be counted on to perform as expected.  Really?

This makes no sense, but if it's going to happen the Portland office needs to be subsidized by the state DEQ office not local taxes."

I'm not sure where along the line they missed their ability to be ""tolerant"" and simply choose to not become a patron of Saffron Colonial.    I can't imagine living in a fashion where EVERY THING associated with history suddenly became offensive,  because essentially if you analyze history,  there isn't a continent, country, or government that hasn't had some association with wrong doing at some point in it's existence."

"Let's make a rule going forward.   If you cannot specify where we should cut and how much we should  cut, you can't advocate for cuts.    Simply demanding ""more cuts"" adds nothing to the conversation and demanding that these undefined cuts take place before revenue measures can be imposed ignores the reality of our situation.    The House spent an entire session and came up with cuts of 1% in the operational budget, the Senate 2%.    Walker said cuts up to 16% would be necessary, but still submitted a budget which increased costs 2%.     So, if you are simply going to advocate for cuts alone, use the budget tool:  http://www.alaskabudget.com/spending and specify where and how much we should cut.    That at least provides a starting point for a real discussion.    I suspect you'll find that, realistically, we could only get to 5% per year in real cuts.   Budget cuts will be only a small part of the solution and must occur in tandem with revenue enhancement, not as a prerequisite."

"Lest we forget:
1. Private banks loan money into existence, at interest, for profit;
2. Such money, made widely available, at low rates of interest, inflates real estate prices;
3. Risks associated with highly leveraged mortgages (<20% down) are socialized, if need be, by the CMHC, which poses a moral hazard; profits remain private. Banks can't lose;
4. It would appear that Mr. Holt forgets that non-recourse mortgages (""jingle mail"") exist in Alberta;

Asking a banker if buying real estate is a good idea at any particular time is on par with asking a barber if you need a haircut. Mr. Holt's all-is-well message is transparently self-serving and flies in the face of mounting evidence that home prices have overshot any reasonable and sustainable plateau."

"The contemplatives rarely had a parish priest preach regarding the contemplative way.  Pastors care for the flock wherever they are in life.  Read about the saints, the contemplative ones often times where naturally inclined to such contemplation through the prompting of the holy spirit, and they were taught by other contemplatives.  So, yes the church does teach the contemplative path, just not in the pulpit.  Many of the doctors of the church were contemplatives.  The doctors of the church are teachers of the church.

We can not expect the church to hold our hand through every stage of our spiritual development, it can guide us, and be a beacon to heaven, but without allowing ourselves to be tested in the valley of the shadow of death, or the dark night of the soul, then we won't receive the refinement of the soul necessary for whole union with God."

"The Domestic Violence system is RIGGED against men - PERIOD !! There are virtually NO provisions for women abusing men. Nanci Kriedman can look up the numbers, women are overwhelmingly the abused - NO QUESTION. But there are MANY women who abuse men. Last I checked, the statistics say it's up to over 4% of DV cases. That isn't including the shame men feel IF they report it. I DID and HPD sent an officer that laughed at me for reporting my ex-wife threw an object at my head, in front of my 8 year old daughter. Then, she falsely reported a threat to her life from me. Thank God for Detective Garcia, who researched our case and discovered phone records  that made it impossible for me to have made any threats. However, they did NOT charge her for making a false report just threatened they would if she did it again !! Think if it was a male no charges would have been filed ????

No businessman is going to increase his insurance costs by eliminating a benefit which actually reduces insurance payouts.

Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); breast enlargement, lumps, pain, or tenderness; depression; nipple discharge; testicular pain.

ABC News reported that George Washington University researchers conducting a study into the drug interviewed men who reported side effects such as erectile dysfunction, decreased sexual drive, problems with orgasms, shrinking and painful genitals, even some neurological problems, such as depression, anxiety and mental fogginess.

Their archaic view of homosexuality in a time where it is not disorder but simply a natural variation is not the charity the Church stands for.

"Foreign policy is always an extension of domestic politics. No exclusion.

Trump's action was politically motivated, shallow, opportunist, reactionary, poorly thought out, incredibly irresponsible, and unbelievably dangerous.

Many will argue that the end justifies the means, and that doing the right thing even for the wrong reason is excusable and even laudable. But Trump's ends are short term political gain, and the long term global ends are potentially catastrophic. When reactionary violence is undertaken by careless people protecting or promoting their own interests, it cannot end well for anyone - least of all those on whose behalf the action was supposedly taken."

It doesn't affect the die-hard Trump haters, but who cares? They were a lost cause anyway.  Don't bother trying to win them over. Let them fester in their own hatred and lunacy.
     I'm sick and tired of conservatives trying to look ""Presidential"" and taking the high road. Doesn't do anything but allow the left to take advantage of the maturity gap. The child is always given more leeway than the parent or teacher. Smart kids take advantage of that. No more.

You can take it any way you want. What was the point of your sophomoric question?

They just want to be treated equally. They aren't in jobs, housing or our justice system.  Just exactly do you mean by dealt with? Just treat everyone like they are citizens of this country. It really shouldn't be that hard."
"I'd be all for removing tax exemptions to simplify the tax code, as long as the increased revenue is matched by an overall tax rate reduction so that net taxes collected remains the same.  Otherwise it is nothing but a back door tax increase.  The problem with this state's budget isn't lack of money, it is a poor set of priorities."

"As if you weren't thrilled that Dems had a 60-vote supermajority 8 years ago that allowed them to pass Obamacare in 100% partisan fashion.

I've said many times that no 100% partisan healthcare policy is going to work in this country.  Which is precisely why we have to repeal 100% partisan Obamacare FIRST so we can start over to build a bipartisan system.  Everyone knows damn well that Dems will never vote for any significant reforms as long as Obamacare is still the law.  R's have to repeal it first, and only then will there be any chance of a bipartisan plan occurring."
"Agree - MSW needs to be educated about PP.  His criticisms are so much - *the sky is falling*.

Guess he missed the news yesterday in which a federal judge has blocked the sonogram ridiculousness of the state of Indiana.  Why, without PP, these types of cultural war ignorance would be the rule and the norm.  MSW appears to have a difficult time arriving at a consistent life ethic - he is pro-birth one day; anti-abortion the next; and then forgets that pro-life is so much larger than the single or cultural abortion wars.  One day he is Lori's acolyte and the next his critic.

Found that sentence to be what many would call - a careless throwaway line."
"I believe both of your are right. It was about money and about political hardball to make more money. Aetana expects a certain return on investment (ROI) or return on assets (ROA) (whichever method they use to measure profit) in order to be a top performer (every businesses' goal) in their industry. The merger was part of the plan for growth to obtain whatever their goal was for ROI or ROA. The government told them no, so they chose their second strategy which was to cut costs and increase efficiency. Right or wrong, that is how private industry works. Aetana knew they were negotiating from a much stronger position than the government and could live with whatever decision the government made. The problem the government has is that the ACA in the end is a bad program which can only work as long as the private sector gets what they need out of it. And when they don't, they walk. This is the problem when kids with hyper egos (politicians and their staffs) play a game against grown-ups."

I doubt you can find where Obama wanted the ACA named Obamacare.  The name came from the Republican ranks as a away to target the president.  Now the same Republicans want to avoid tying Trump to their new plan.  It appears they also want to avoid being tied to the plan they just introduced that is unacceptable to their own ranks.  Maybe it should be called FAUXCARE as access to health care is not actually getting health care.
"No one is circumventing anything as they are following one of the processes under our laws by which one may be recognized as a Convention Refugee. as defined in s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).

Arriving in Canada without legal status and claiming refugee status is one of the legal options under the IRPA which incorporates into domestic law one of our longstanding international obligations to refugees going back to 1951.  It is a major reason for the existence of the Refugee Protection Division and its predecessor tribunals.

BTW s.133 of the current IRPA provides an exemption for refugees for prosecution for illegal entry to Canada.  This exemption dates back to the UN 1951 Convention on Refugees contained in Article 31.

The oral hearing process before an independent administrative tribunal has been part of our law for over three decades and the reasons for it were set out in the 1985 SCOC decision in Singh v Canada [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177."

"C'mon now Enrico, that is as bad an argument I have seen yet... the gospel in a nutshell is love God and love your neighbor as yourself.

To claim that a merciful view of the gospel is ""dogmatic"" is inconsistent with the overarching gospel message and simply doesn't hold water. And how you can fathom for one second the possibility of  Jesus being  ""a sadistic maniac deceiving everyone into misery and gleefully awaiting the moment to cast everyone into hell"" is beyond me... in fact, it seems you have gone out of your way to cast our loving, merciful Savior--even if ""our"" understanding is a little off--as one who possesses Satan-like qualities...

"Marriage is a choice not a right. Government should get out of the whole business as their only interest in marriage is tax purposes.

If the church wants to run as a tourist attraction for destination weddings performing secular weddings rather than the sacrament of marriage they  become subject to secular laws."

"A much better answer than allowing Deacons to run things or throwing Deacons at any parish. Any diocese can do this anywhere in the world by just allowing both lay men & women to be empowered to do all the same things that Deacons do, which is already perfectly allowable under church laws, if any Bishop wishes to have trained lay leaders do these ministries instead. This means lay leaders baptizing, Leading & preaching & proclaiming the Gospel & giving homilies at Eucharistic Celebrations with previously consecrated hosts, officiating at weddings & funerals. In S. America many diocese have had both trained lay women & men doing these things for decades. 

We need to stop prioritizing by what will make mostly white, wealthy, men in our church happy, & instead ask what is the best mode of operation for the health of individual parishes, what truly represents justice, & what will make the church not only heal but also grow & increase in the future.

AND WE MUST DEMAND WOMEN PRIESTS!"

Also a lot depends on voter turnout, otherwise if voter turnout stays as high Trudeau will probably get back in, but if it falls enough that will help the Tories as Tory supporters may be smaller in numbers but are more likely to vote so like in US and UK, generally high turnout favours progressive parties and low turnout more conservative ones."

Since Trump and Ryan will do nothing I urge anyone who is a victim of hate to step forward and press charges against Trump and Ryan as well as suing their asses for all they are worth . They are by their words and actions and inaction , complicit in any attack verbally or physically . Even if charging them with a crime  suing them is not successful a clear and loud message will be sent that Trump and the Repugnantcans will be held accountable .

"Very comprehensive overview of the challenge of creating solutions to homelessness in Eugene and Springfield.

And the hundred-plus people who have a temporary shelter every day and night in our two cities because of this program--at the Rest Stops and in Conestoga Huts at various locations--are no doubt appreciative as well.  

The challenge is finding humane ways to expand this and other programs--like Opportunity Village and Square One Village--to help people find stability and a way forward in their lives."

2). I agree that many immigrants are not able to communicate in English. However - the more ""highly educated"" immigrant, coming to the US (priest, doctor, engineer, other professional) most certainly can speak & understand English. Perhaps not every idiom, but it is taught as a matter of course in schools throughout the world...it is understood that Americans are traditionally not polyglots.
3). We are considered a ""missionary country"" at this point.  Priests certainly understand that, and most are anxious to come here...

"It's not Lame County's fault China put the green wall in place to prevent unrecyclable hard plastic from coming in; I'll give the dump a pass on that one. $5 per tire is quite cheap. Does everyone else need to subsidize motorists at every step of the way? And if you can't maneuver a trailer in the space provided, it's time you either took some lessons or realized you're just too low-skilled to use a trailer. Does the county need to provide valet parking?

I'm quite impressed with how user-friendly the Glenwood transfer station is. I'm in and out in no time flat, the staff is always helpful and generally cheerful, which is impressive in a dump setting, and the place is kept fairly clean and free of tire-damaging debris. Also, the prices are incredibly low.

Perhaps they thought his girlfriend would inspire him to be a good member of society, of course it probably would not have. Maybe his parents were terrified of him. Who knows, but I am sure for one thing, his parents are just as sad at the way things turned out. My question is why did not she not leave him, was she terrified to? I think that thankfully most of us have not had a sociopath in our family circle who is not only crazy but meaner than a junk your dog, and that can strike terror in anyone's heart because they often kill their own family members."

The sun's output also changes over long periods of time.  And there are other causes at work as well.

Now those same people are telling us that the warming we've seen over the last 120 years is caused by humans dumping billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.  The science behind this is well established, and we understand how to separate natural causes from human causes.

Not only is it mostly women but it is also mostly white women.  Same with elementary school teachers.

I would like to see all sectors change to eliminate bias to any genders but that would be wishful thinking."

I wrote, ""However, the vast majority of cases of 'child-abuse' were homosexual encounters (between priests and pubertal and post-pubertal teenage boys). This means that homosexually inclined priests are more likely to abuse children."" No way can this be construed as equating paedophilia with homosexuality. The vast majority of abuse by priests involved pubertal and post pubertal boys which is not paedophilia. It is more commonly known as hebophilia and ephebophilia; note that I am talking about priests not the general public.
In fact, I also wrote, ""This is not the same as saying that in general, homosexuals are more likely to be child abusers.""  Which means exactly what it says, homosexuals generally are NOT necessarily more likely to be child abusers.
Your accusation as usual is again absolutely false."

"The Holy Spirit moves through that God given intelligence.  Apostles are not just the the Twelve, but every witness to the resurrection.  When the last of these died, Pastors inherited their role of witnessing the resurrection of Christ.  As for natural law, it is the province of everyone who uses reason.  It does not depend on authority, indeed when authority is used to overrule the results of reason, it is only because it has lost the argument.  

In pre-Vatican II days, there was a large infrastructure of censorship to keep all teaching in line, with scholars required to seek Imprimater and Nihil Obstat from their local ordinaries and the Holy Office overseeing it all and the Index used to condemn anyone who resisted. Vatican II and the papal decrees implementing it destroyed most of this nonsense.  Now condemnation by CDF is a badge of honor and a way to sell more books."

People from the mainland with nothing else better to do can say the most ridiculous things like people from the mainland do.  Hawaii isn't Tonga where the federal judge won't extradite the caucasian man accused of killing his wife in Tonga or on his boat.  This Tonga incident is for good cause or reasoning.  If a low-profile prosecutor is assigned to the Kealoha's case which usually happens in Hawaii there won't be any conviction either.

The sexual assault was hot sause down the butt. they didn't rape the guy. And Clark hit him with a medal rod basically and tide him up. Everything else were the other 2 men. And they were all under the influence of some bad drug because Clark would have more sense and wouldn't have the guts to go that far if it wasn't for the drugs. Children are getting hold of these drugs from other kids and these other kids are getting it from their parents. And so the good kids get so rapped up in it that the parents kick them out on the streets at young ages like 16 to 17 years of age and don't know how to take care of themselves and do drugs. So all the people that are insulting these young men would have probably done the same thing if u guys were on the same drugs.

"Alceste: The British PM likely wouldn't agree with your perspective. She's noted that one of the biggest single hurdles to resolving the current terrorism problem is that a large portion of the population in one community (which we're discouraged from identifying in Canada) too often rejects the concept of pluralism or liberalism. As a NY Times article, written by a Muslim author, recently noted, his own community often demands the benefits of pluralism without accepting that the concept entails an obligation of tolerance toward the broader society: ""Often Muslims support liberalism when it serves them and reject it when it does not."" PM May has stated that Britain needs to have a frank discussion about this cultural disconnect.  Chilling shenanigans like M-103, which clearly intends to suppress such discussion, clearly aren't conducive to a healthy debate within a free and democratic society.

Is Canadian food hot dogs, hamburgers and maybe a slice of pizza (oops that's Italian). What Canadian literature do people read? Do they really spend their time reading Margaret Atwood and Alice Munroe or do they pick up an American or British novel. What Canadian plays and maybe opera do people actually know or have seen? Multi-culturalism exists in large part because there is no real Canadian culture outside of hockey, poutine and maple syrup."

"Trump's behaving like the Mad Hatter, zigzagging to and fro without a clue of how his campaign rhetoric may very well hurt our nation.  Trump has legitimate points (jobs, immigration, healthcare etc.) but he doesn't care to bring any congressional delegation in before taking his clever undoing what the Obama administration help create and protect.  I sure hope the Democrats stay on top of the madness and throw barriers up as fast as Trump is zigzagging public policies.  Appears Trump is heading down a rabbit hole."

On the tax rate, you're confusing income tax rates with actual income tax revenue. No one actually paid 90%. The rich simply hire accountants and use the countless loopholes to get out of it. 

It's disingenious to use Ike's tax rates as a model, because you don't really want to go there. During his admin, spending was 28% of GDP, with 15% of GDP going to defense and a 3% of GDP deficit.  Pensions, healthcare, education, and welfare (entitlements) combined were 6% of GDP.  in 2010, govt spends 40% of GDP, 9% of GDP to deficit, 6% GDP goes to defense and entitlements take up a whopping 23% of GDP.

They require the black market of sexual harassment and rape. Trump types only get sex when they buy it or by forcing themselves on attractive women who always reject them because they are so grotesque. Let's face it. Real men get what they want by having something to offer. Money can only buy sex from people who prostitute themselves. These are the only women who would have sexual relations with a Trump or a Trump type. Trump will always be a john."

"Caron has the most substance and sadly gets little mention even though he has been surprising strong. Singh is seen as the front-runner and so has avoided taking big risks, but the party needs someone who can  grab media attention the way Jack Layton did because he was media savvy.

Angus seems like a nice guy but to me his manner doesn't seem that strong or tough, and Ashton seems to be playing to the left of the party and identity politics rather than having anything new to say on jobs or the economy or to city dwellers in particular."

"Sorry but that's an officer that needs to go. Not only because  he may be vulnerable to loosing control but he may have made the Facebook post to let his superiors know he doesn't trust himself. It's either a message of take me off the Force or simple stupidity if he thought it ""clever or funny"".  Either of which suggests he is questioning his own self control."
"so should the First nations feel shame for their tribe on tribe atrocities, perhaps the torture of white men and the Jesuit,  or do we keep the falsehood of the peaceful one with nature fantasy we describe today."

"The reason they can't get the message out is because nobody wants to hear it.  What you see in Washington DC is exactly what the masses want.  The big parties sell them fear, the idea that their lives need government protecting them, and that they could have more if we take from the other guy, and the voters buy right into it.  Our culture is a ""me"" culture.  Libertarians try to sell the idea that you don't need government and to make the country good it will require the people doing it for themselves.  That actually works when you don't have the greedy infighting we do here.

Not a big Stein follower...can't speak to her or her party.

Johnson did speak well to foreign issues.  The media pounced all over him when he was unaware of Aleppo.  In the grand scheme of things, to OUR government and country, was Aleppo so important?  Nope.  But, the media didn't say much when Hillary said Mosul was a border town (it isn't) and that's actually important because we have troops in Mosul."

"It amazes me how often fiscal conservatives will simply revert to first principles - Econ 101, as we say - as a justification for any policy or any particular policy. Sure, ""choice"" and ""competition"" are good. But how good? How much choice is optimal? How much competition? And what will we sacrifice for them?
The point about the health care market is *not*, as the author implies, that we think it's ""too complicated"" for free markets. That's a strawman. 
The point is that free markets do not work to deliver market goods to all people. Free markets are great for setting market prices, and below that price no one gets the services. That's not complex, it's simple: If you want a Canada where your neighbour gets health care even if they're poor or lost their job or unemployed or differently abled, then we do not want and cannot afford a free-market system. 
Talking about the warm fuzzy feelings ""choice"" and ""competition"" give you does not address that."
"So, Don, why talk about tourists in Europe at all, then? And why have those tourists in your lead paragraph?

I am not buying it. There was no need to paint 1. the picture of the American tourists at all and 2. the specific picture of the Canada flag disguises allegedly widely used by American tourists UNLESS your goal was to have readers associate the phrase ""Ugly American"" with TOURISTS.

Seriously, Don, it is beyond me why you want to cut slack for the columnist and editor on this one. The association they have made is clear and loud."

"I agree, Neko.  It was all down hill after Christianity became the official state religion under Constantine..  In that short period of time from its inception to the next 300 hundred years Christianity moved from the persecuted remnant of believers to the persecutors of those who disagreed in any way..  Regal splendor, authority and legalism have pressed hard against the original simple teachings of Jesus ever since.  Today one would hardly recognize that it is the same religion that Jesus founded.  What in the world have we done?"
"Thank you, David. Enjoyed your response. Agree with you that statues are odd: the obvious, rather gauche immortality projects of previous generations left clogging up contemporary landscapes; the feeble expressions of fragile egos attempting to bolster claims of victory and superiority.

Am more in favour of winners renaming areas instead. As tiresome as it can prove for those navigating an area after it has been renamed, the process does offer the benefits of being relatively easy, inexpensive and efficient. It is also much easier for the next set of winners to declare their ""victory"" in the future."
"How is it possible for Pope F. and entire RCI clergies not know that God is immanent as well as omnipresent in this universe?  When priest rape children, they are raping God, these ignorant bishops & prelates, not only cover up but enable them to continue some thirty years to rape God in children.  Why these sick monsters still in RCC masquerade as a man of God?
And many sick Catholics defend these monsters like you Joseph S. O'Leary for what?  You don't believe there is God, do you?  Or your image of God is an old men who sit on cloud in high sky, enjoy being raped by clergies, smile/nod head in approval of Pope F, C. Pell, Joseph S. O'Leary!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will always be loyal to him, I might not agree with everything he was doing in his life but I would only express that to him in private. Don't you worry about me Mr. Cleanup Eugene. These are crazy, polarizing times and the best reflection you can do is on yourself.

But nice attempt at taking a jab at me. I am naturally crazy & defend those I love so shut your stupid mouth."
"What arrogant and flagrant whining from the Canadian cheap seats! Trump has certainly underwhelmed in his first weeks of leadership...but this article parallels that performance. It's just a broad put down by a jealous Canadian.

To criticize a man for financial success by demanding that he sell his business and its assets assigns electoral leadership to the poor, the unsuccessful and the bureaucratic toady. Nothing Donald Trump has done in structuring his personal finances is at all offside with the demands of his position. Nothing. And better people that Barrie McKenna have scrubbed that issue raw.

C'mon, McKenna...(and Canada).  Your national envy is showing. What will you ever do when Trump succeeds?"
Thank you Cory Gardner..  Thought you were one of those weak kneed loser RINOs.  I stand corrected.

The culture in hockey is like a disease in that it quickly kills any resemblance of a personality in those who play, hence we get players like Crosby and McDavid who are great on ice but can't string together an original sentence if they tried. Whenever someone like PK Subban comes along, the discomfort in the NHL with a player having a personality and mind of his own is palpable. 
Contrast that with every sporting organization in the world, who would take that PK Subban and make him/her the poster child for their sport. Just look at what Usain Bolt has done for sprinting. People tune in to watch him as a person first and his speed second."

"""Introvert"" - yes, that was the label rolled out by the PMO to excuse Harper's disdain for the press, his disdain for taking questions, and his general cowardice in facing unscripted questions from the public.     In reality - Harper was a bully, profane, domineering in caucus, and a true narcissist who used public money to create a Hall of pictures (of himself) in a Parliamentary lobby, a 24/7 Channel dedicated to himself, and even sent out his first PM Christmas card as a picture of himself, alone, staring at a window full of pictures of himself.

Harper was no ""introvert"" - that was just a sorry excuse used to explain his behaviour after the fact.     It's actually a slap in the face to introverts to use that label for Harper."

It is BPA financed,  and the members are BPA paid,  but Oregon Democrats,  in their infinite wisdom,  in the legislature and governor's office,  have that money paid to Oregon from BPA,  and then Oregon pays the Oregon members.  Just like UO did with Nike supplemental money for football coaches,  so that they can live in splendid luxury in retirement.  That the money now comes from rank and file employee pay is only fair.

"The media's job in a free and democratic society is not to blow kisses and wave pom poms at the government all the time but to speak truth to power and to hold government to account for its  bungling, bumph, burglary, boondoggles and for the dichotomies between what they say and promise and what they actually do.

To put it another way, the press reports plane crashes not plane landings.

Sir John A. MacDonald had the definitive observation on the role of the press.  He observed, ""Given a strong majority, a weak opposition and an apathetic press, we could debauch a choir of archangels"".

Margaret Wente is one of the very best political journalists we have in discharging the vital role of the media in regard to government.

"I speak for me, a youngish Catholic who had experienced both forms of the Roman rite.  Who do you speak for? My experience is there is perhaps a handful of EFs available in the major metropolitan archdioceses I've lived in. EF is one of the Church's best kept secrets, and little is done to promote it, and a lot is done to suppress and downplay it. It's near miraculous it's survived with how much was done to disappear it. I think that if you study the two liturgies side by side, the EF clearly expresses the Mass is the Holy Sacrifice. Someone who hasn't been to both can't make that assessment. Obviously, many disagree. Is my ""contempt"" any more scandalous than Pope Francis' comments on rigid young Catholics who prefer the Traditional Mass who have something behind their love for the EF Mass?"
"Firstly Im going to say this, rape is wrong and against the law and rapists should be treated as criminals and jailed.  Secondly I'm going to say that the inclusion of awkward sexual advances including inappropriate initial acts of touching/kissing are not going to go away.  Why? Because not every man interprets the sexual receiving signals of women perfectly in every social situation.  Sometimes we press in for the anticipated kiss when she's just not that into it.  Happened to many of us.  Wrong move on the wrong gal.  Guys that ask permission to kiss are just not the kind of guy women want.  Just watch any chick flick when to moment comes for Mr right to lean in and kiss/caress her, does he stop and ask ""I must ask for your permission to kiss you now?""  Nope.  He just does it.  And sometimes, us men, well we just plain mis-interpret the often very confusing lady signals and therefore lean in and go for it.  Never forget that both men and women are still biologically sexual animals."

"Wrong.  The ""anti-cat/witch familiar"" pogrom in western Europe took place AFTER the plague pandemic--had nothing to do with it.  The source of the plague was the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), populations of which along the Old Silk Road underwent a plague outbreak.  Plague-carrying fleas jumped from them to caravan camels and traders who carried them to European markets.  Thereafter people, cats and rats caught, spread and died from the plague.  The cats couldn't have done anything to control the actual plague-vector, which not only wasn't THERE but had almost certainly died of the plague itself by the time the plague it reached Europe.

As for the schizophrenia/Alzheimer's link, that was the conclusion of a medical research paper released just last year.  When I have time I'll post links to articles addressing both.

"It's impossible to overstate or exaggerate the incompetence or depth of personality defects suffered by Mr. Trump. 

He lied non-stop about the progress in Puerto Rico, even knowing that people listening to him KNOW he's lying.  That's called pathological lying, and he has done it his entire adult lifetime.

A worthless fraud.  He cannot be removed from office soon enough."
I think the numbers are wrong
"And why are you asking this question?

"Actually, Liliane, Professor Kempten does not suggest prohibiting contraception, but rather that the Church and her entities not be forced to pay for it.  Practice contraception if you want, if your conscience will permit, but be prepared to pay for it yourself.  And, if you cannot afford contraception, then perhaps the best solution is abstinence.  The exact same can be said for abortion - pay for it yourself, do not demand individuals, companies or churches that are utterly opposed to abortion, to fund it.

Moreover, for 2000 years, abortion has been understood to be nothing more or less than murder.  Couch it in whatever pleasing terms you like, it is the deliberate and premeditated taking of innocent human life.  The intentional taking of innocent life is always a moral atrocity.  Of course, it should be prohibited, just as all murder is prohibited.  Women do not get a free pass to murder just because they are women."

"It's nice to know rapture that some higher power has bestowed upon you the ""right"" or whatever you want to call it, to determine which companies or entities are doing the right and wrong things.

"I don't frequent the riverside bike paths as much as I did before I retired (6 years ago) but the few times I have been on them in the last year or so I have seen EPD on bikes, motorcycles, and even patrol cars in a few places where it is vehicle accessible.  I think a large part of the problem is the tolerance of Eugene government for ""wanderers"" or whatever Kitty P likes to call them and how they have essentially taken over parts of the bike path and downtown.  Took my grandsons to the Skinner Butte play area a couple of weeks ago (about 11:00 AM) to play.  Grandson asked if we could walk down and look at the river.  Both places where I started down had tents with people sleeping in them along the river.  The bike path and parks that Eugene were so proud a decade ago are now places where many people, including most women, are afraid to venture alone even in the middle of the day."
"So, instead of Bears Ears national monument, are we down to Bear's Ear national monument? Or Bear's Eardrum national monument? Or First Ten Hairs of Bear's Cochlea national monument?

"This is horrible,  I can see limiting row rentals, but I got lucky as a low wage worker I was able to buy a few acres with a monthly land payment I can make on my 10 dollar an hour wage. My 2 boys and me have hand cleared the area to build a small 400 hundred sq foot home. That small home will save us from drowing in rent will allow us to have a small farm and save a monthly food bill, I will not be woring about renting on a low wage job when I am 60.  On that 9 acres my sons can build their homes and always have a roof, so they are not traped in the low wage work 2 jobs to keep the basic bills paid trap and can have the time and energy to go to school.  Government has always been about holding people down I guess matsu is no different I feel for the working poor their and hope they vote the snobs out. Any one who says with hard work you can move forward in a low wage job is full of it, the ones that move forward are the ones that have a poor work ethic, I work my butt off"

"Yes, it the old French and Latin, well before it was recognized as the name of a Sacrement, which also was not recognized until 1000 years ago.

"I don't know what ""significant portion"" means, or why it would be relevant to my viewpoint, but thanks for giving me a further opportunity to elaborate on charters. The longliners cried for years that the charter operators were crowding into their (free) quotas, implying or stating that the charters were taking fish away from them. That, of course, was the big lie, one that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, was only too eager to embrace.

In reality, the charter operators are water taxis that bring fishermen to the halibut holes. The charter crew cannot catch or keep one ounce of halibut. Only the client fishermen - and I think that it is safe to assume that they are almost all Americans, and probably mostly Alaskans - can keep those halibut. So who owns the charter boat is irrelevant, and is trotted out as a straw man.

Now, with charter IFQs, Americans get to pay more for charters that offer dramatically reduced catch limits. For fish we used to own. Thanks to greed."

"Morguard and Hunt dealt with the enforcement of judgments between Canadian provinces, which under Canadian law have the jurisdiction to regulate enforcement of foreign judgments with respect to most areas of law. However, the Supreme Court specifically noted in Morguard the need in the modern world economy to facilitate the flow of wealth, skills and people across state lines in a fair and orderly manner. As such, these cases must be considered in assessing the issue of the enforcement of foreign judgments in Canada.
Canadas lower courts have almost universally applied the Morguard principles of enforceability to judgments originating outside Canadas borders. This extension of Morguard has considerably simplified the enforcement procedure for foreign litigants.

The doctors did make recommendations - the government ignored them and isolated the physicians from talks/plans. Make a choice - who knows best on what patients need - aside from patients (in many/some cases) government or physicians? Without the doctors when it comes down to money and only money. Is there anyone out there that has been to the ER or their doctor's appointment and seen doctors lazing around? Most are running around frantically trying to serve everyone - the doctor's are feeling and rightly so as being scapegoats for an ineffective system and the newest and latest LHIN proposals are not going to fix this.

That is not much of a basis for friendship over the medium to long term.

Turkey has also done considerable damage to its credibility within NATO, and by its tacit support of ISIS until recently, further isolating itself."

"The only ones sinking lower are the Fake News and the elites and their never-ending sleazy and underhanded attacks on President Donald J. Trump.

Trump has every right to pardon Sheriff Joe.  The law of the land says the President can pardon anyone at anytime. What's the problem?  How can Trump be against the law if he's following the law?  Let's hear the Fake News and elites explain that conundrum.

Sheriff Joe was the victim of an unjust judicial attack by the Obama administration. All of us would want a pardon if we were convicted unjustly by a regime that wanted us jailed us for our political beliefs.

Trump did the right thing, as always. And as always, the Fake News and elites can't handle it. Go Trump!"

"People will abandon their cats or strays that are found when they are turned away by the uncaring ""no-kill"" shelters who would rather defend their unrealistic philosophy than help people with nowhere else to turn. People then learn that it is acceptable to abandon cats rather than to take responsibility and own up to their commitment to their cat or choose to ignore a stray cat that they find when their good deed leads them to a brick wall.

TNR has worked so well that shelters are overflowing with cats to the point that they have permanently closed their doors to taking in cats, ""rescue groups"" are inundated, foster homes are overwhelmed with many of these ""foster"" cats never leaving because there are no homes for them...so ""no-kill"" keeps inventing new categories (community cats, barn cats, working cats etc) to disguise the outdoor feral cats to make them palatable to the public.

"What's wrong with Boeing's executive management Eric!?

No wonder Boeing seems to be getting its competitive butt kicked by Airbus!!!  Lastly, I still think it is much more cost effective for us to purchase Super Hornets as a stop-gap plane from Boeing, considering we've been operating its ""cousin"" the Hornet for years, but Canada should cut its proposed order to a bare minimum of say 9 from 18 plus throw out the other stupid idiotic idea I've read about to buy 10 Hornets at the end of their frigging  lifespan from Australia!!!"
"That is what is both implied and assumed by the person saying it and receiving it. But that is not ANNOUNCING that one is heterosexual.

I can appreciate the journey & effort this individual has made to challenge himself.

It is not about him. It is about learning, it is about appreciation of how big life is when someone chooses to embrace an adventure. A well-thought out adventure. And the challenge was taken on with skill, knowledge and more of a plan than you see some drivers on paved roads seem to have changing lanes every too often in short distance.

The difference between a real adventure, the mindset to accomplish this, is way different than most northern stories. Apparently he was up to the task, makes friends easily; & those who are caught up in a limited urban circle of life need to get out more. ;)"

"The Republican process of intellectual and moral deterioration began four decades ago, during the era anti-Trump conservatives now point to as the golden age of conservative thought.
Irving Kristol, the godfather of neoconservatism, embraced supply-side economics  the claim, refuted by all available evidence, that tax cuts pay for themselves by boosting economic growth. 
Years later, he boasted about valuing political expediency over intellectual integrity: I was not certain of its economic merits but quickly saw its political possibilities. 
In other words, in order to create a Republican majority, he was comfortable with intellectual dishonesty and false doctrine."
Awesome news! Where can I sign?
"Considering Trump's business record and reputation for coming back on deals that have been inked, Canada would be unwise to take anything he says at face value.

Nice of him to say that . . . . . . but, you're crazy to believe that's the end of it.

On the positive side, you can see foreign governments and businesses already developing psychological profiles on Trump and, from there, strategies to get what they want out of him. 

Flattering his ego, giving him an opportunity to look good, seems to go a long way towards keeping you out of petulant crosshairs.."

In 2012, the European Union adopted mandatory regulations requiring all new trucks exceeding 3,500 kilograms (7716 lbs) to be fitted with advanced emergency braking systems. The systems initially alert drivers and then take evasive action. The regulation was adopted to reduce the number of rear-end collisions by trucks. A simple alarm retrofitted to ALL trucks should be mandatory here. Advanced systems mandatory in new trucks. You can get automatic emergency braking in economy cars now. The system will be mandatory in new light vehicles by 2022. Why is this not already mandatory in trucks here? The system even stopped a terrorist attack last year at the Berlin Christmas market where someone tried to drive a truck through the crowd.

Perhaps because it was a protest she showed up uniformed, but was not actually an officer.  And yes, bottom line is that no matter who is the spokesperson, it's HPD brass calling the shots.

He is all bluff and bluster. He also has a huge army and if you do attack him he won't hesitate to hit back and also maybe hit Seoul as well. And then there is China. China will not tolerate it. And then lo you  are also at war with China and WW3 is on with nuclear weapons.

"I think activists dug through his posts thinking ""this condo guy is an asshole racist gentrifier and I'm gonna find evidence of him being a dick so I can disseminate it and ruin him"" and have framed it as racist because of Tyler's position on other issues.

Like that Hollywood thing: He says he has been conditioned to fear certain types of cars by movies. And then he says that nothing happened,  and he was was never in danger. The moral of the story isn't that the neighborhood was a bad place for him to be, it's that he was irrationally fearful based on images he'd been exposed to in media and concluded that it was wrong. That's what I got, anyway.

I am from a diverse city but I'm no authority on race or crime. I understand that I have a privileged perspective. I also agree that his five year old blog post could be read differently than I'm reading it and that it's tonedeaf. But the message I got was the exact opposite of racism."

"Richard if you live in Alaska chances are that oil money passes through your hands every time you receive a pay check. You're use of this money is just like a subsidy, it leaves your hands and goes to pay somebody else unless you put it in the bank for a while. So goes the money that is given out as a subsidy for anything. The people in the villages give it back for services, they don't keep it and it pays wages to some more people and makes it's way back to the cities and as profits to out of state owned stores. That's life. People even complain about government workers, very few put money in savings but how else could the government dish out oil profits to the economy for circulation, maybe set up giveaway counters. So the state gives salaries for work done and it passes through the economy. A dollar bill really isn't good for anything, can't blow your nose with it or wipe something but through faith in it you can buy things to blow or inhale. So it goes, live life and enjoy."

"Which historian has argued that significant numbers of black troops fought for the CSA? Where? Using what sources? You're making  a fabulously provocative claim w/out any sources. 

The only thing I know like that concerns a group of free men of color in New Orleans who tried, unsuccessfully, to enlist in the Confederate forces as a unit, The Louisiana Native Guards.

When Union forces took New Orleans in 1862(?) however,  the Native Guards enlisted in the UNION army. They guarded POW's in coastal Mississippi and fought at the Battle of Pascagoula . . . for the Union. 

Black Union troops fought heroically at any number of battles, often suffering horrendous casualty rates: Port Hudson, Fort Pillow, Battery Wagner, Nashville, the Battle of the Crater and others. 

Where did black CSA troops do this?

"Unprincipled legalese and total Garbage. The current system is an complete outrage! How dare you defend it? How is it that the rest of Canada gets it but not the BC Liberals? It undermines a citizens vote for unaccountable money. It sells out the public good for private corporate and possibly foreign  interests ( like real estate). Its crony ineffective capitalism undermining a functional democracy.  

Democracy should be a competition of ideas about the way to forward the public good. Not how to screw the taxpayer and citizen for a few bucks. The current system completely undermines this idea. Good ideas that are hampered or killed because the wealthy company bribed the right government is not progress. It fascism.

Staffers make very good salaries.  They get per diem as well.  But no one scrutinizes the freebies they're getting from lobbyists.  Buy a staffer and you've bought the legislator.  And the more staffers a legislator has, the more opportunities to buy that politician.  Meyer has at least 5 staffers.  How many does yours have?"

Perhaps you can provide a source showing the Church suppressed lay access to the Bible. 

Rather strange comment, since it was the Church provided the means of preserving & producing most of the ancient documents.

Some Bibles, considered heretical, may have been  restricted, but I believe that was all."

"What is the purpose of evaluating if someone is equally forgiving? Where is that going? Shall we now question if one of us is more forgiving than the other.?

It is being applied based on place of birth, not just where they are flying from. Long term holders of the right to permanent residency (green cards) cannot exit because they will be barred reentry.
Even conservative think tanks are pointing out that no one in the U.S. has been killed by a refugee from these countries even though hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) have been admitted.

I'm surprised that nobody on Canada's part thought about this loophole when negotiating the agreement with the Americans. It's not as though it couldn't have been anticipated. The only feasible approach now might be to change our laws to deny permanent status to anybody who illegally enters Canada after being denied refugee status or abandoning a refugee claim in a safe third country. I'm sure the Americans will provide us any information they have about these migrants. For the sake of the integrity of our border, we have to disincentivize illegal entry."
That's the real collusion to steal this election.

"Nazism wants to eradicate all non-white races. This is a call to violence and an attempt to incite violence against those groups.

I do not disagree that we should allow everyone the ability to say what they want, up until it calls openly for the death of other people. That is against the law and that is what the nazis are doing. They want to kill all jews, blacks, and LGBTQ persons, oh yeah and anyone else they might have beef with that day.

So yes if you defend the words the Nazis are speaking then you are a nazi sympathizer and are equal to the nazis.

If you are defending their right to speak openly about it, then I agree, however only to the point where the start calling for the death of fellow Americans.

We(as a nation) collectively get pissed off when N. Korea kills one kid, or when ISIS says they will destroy our country, but we cannot be upset a bunch of nazi larpers want be able to openly call for ethnic cleansing the USA. That is silly. They are calling for mass murder."

I do not agree with the concept of the Danegeld.  

""The Danegeld (/den.ld/;[1] ""Danish tax"", literally ""Dane tribute"") was a tax raised to pay tribute to the Viking raiders to save a land from being ravaged. It was called the geld or gafol in eleventh-century sources. It was characteristic of royal policy in both England and Francia during the ninth through eleventh centuries, collected both as tributary, to buy off the attackers, and as stipendiary, to pay the defensive forces."
Now that is a seriously stupid headline.

"This is yet another pathetic column by Charles Wohlforth .   He exposed his agenda by telling readers Prevo , in his opinion , hurt a family friend . There was no doubt which way the story would go from there . Just because Wohlforth claims Prevo's day has passed doesn't make it true. Any more than claiming a pastor in Fairview  with a tiny following after only living here a year is an Anchorage Christian leader .    Because of his personal grudge against Prevo he fails to list anything positive Prevo has done for Anchorage over all these years . How fair is that ? Anchorage is a better place for Prevo having been here.  What Wohllforth fails to understand is that basic teachings in the Bible don't change with time.  Anchorage's current most favorite liberal pastor not only doesn't condemn sin , he tells all who will listen basic sins in the Bible are wrong .  Perhaps worst of all is that Wohlforth knows who committed a crime , but won't report it to police.  How honest is that ?"

"The G&M Civil Comments system is an anti-free-speech, thought-control, group-think, coerced behaviour modification tool. You get browbeaten with a dire warning of account restriction/expulsion if you do not agree with ""the system"" that a given comment is ""uncivil,"" when in your opinion it may be pithy and to the point. A box pops up and admonishes you to re-think and reconsider, presumably along vapid, politically-correct party lines - you have to pledge fealty to the ""community standards"" by clicking ""I agree to review fairly."" If not, you're ""restricted"" and you cannot proceed. This is marginally better than the trend to no comment section at all, but not by much."
"Other states that you cite do not have GET as a method of taxation.  So yes, we may have vouchers, and it may be successful for some, and penalize the poor that do not have the additional cash flow to make up  the difference in tuition.

In addition, public schools would have a decreased funding stream that will affect those that do not have the option of school attendance outside of their community.

Please consider that many private schools attempt to keep their tuition affordable, and struggle financially.  Not all private schools have large endowments.  Expect that with vouchers the cost of private school tuition will rise in Hawaii.

Businesses do well when there is equity in education, housing and availability of well paying jobs.  Miinimum wage is only ""regressive"" as you cite because of tax upon tax that is paid by businesses because of GET.

All are considerations to improve life for all in the New Year, and for future generations.

"A number of her colleagues, University administrators, minority student activist leaders, and members of the University community have demanded her resignation for her action.  Theyve, figuratively, broken out the torches and pitchforks and marched for her banishment from the village....the University.  They seek the ultimate punishment a University can inflict on a faculty member.....resign (or be fired) in disgrace and leave campus.....  Such demands, in my opinion, reflect a self-righteous vindictiveness which I find more offensive than Ms. Shurtzs foolish (but not-malevolent) wearing of blackface."
Stupid.  Let parents decide what is best for their own kids.
"The church and many other churches are simply afraid to confront and discuss these issues. The source of difficulty is depiction of women as unclean, impure and inferior. Thus if a man marries, he rendered ritually impure when he has sex with his wife. Of course we are still blaming Eve for causing Adam to sin. This anti-woman attitude stems from eons of patriarchal teaching in all the world's religions. 

Meanwhile, the faithful are starved for the Eucharist and pastoral care. Brazil is only one of the many examples, with the mounting shortages of priest in the USA rapidly rising to a crisis point."

"The proposed pipeline will go near reservation land, but not though it.  A proposal that tribes be paid for the transportation of oil, or anything else, through land that they do not own is unique indeed.  It seems to approach an old-fashioned shakedown or protection scam, peace for cash. When the thing was in the very early stages the tribe could probably have gone to the company with a proposal for an easement, which would have produced a constant flow of income.  This path was not taken, and now someone evidently wants to just shut it all down."

It is especially worrying because our enemies are growing stronger -- e.g. China, Iran & the DPRK -- while the US and its allies -- especially NATO -- are becoming relatively weaker.

"You know, Trump's ""America First' is pure American BS. Because it has been America First, no apology, since the end of WW2. 

It was the U.S. government and its many cohorts and oligarchy that created today situation by practicing unabashed American First policies. Just that the policies benefited the rich, the powerful, the military-industrial complex, the war machine, the Money Mafia. It stopped benefiting the middle class for about 30 years now, since the 1980. The leadership then prop up the situation by creating epic economic bubbles using the U.S. vast power of the dollar. Well, the financial WMD blew up their middle class, along with a few fooled countries. 

Today the gridlocked politicians offer no fix of their mess. A guy called Trump come along and blame the whole thing on trade deals. You can't get more stupid than that. But Trump can certainly get more arrogant and combative.

"Some observations:
Name 5 things Trump has done to benefit citizens.  He's completely failed to fulfill the 10 promises to be done in first 100 days.  What exactly has he done?

Trump doesn't exaggerate or mis-speak.  He lies.  No disputing national murder rate, trade deficit with Canada, date NATO agreed to full funding, or that there's been no proof of voter fraud.  He simply made crap up about all that and said it and it ain't true.  Period.

I think Burke's point is that if he lies on small stuff and gets caught on stuff easy to prove, how can you trust him to tell the truth on the big stuff that cant be proved?  The 7 examples cited aren't debatable.  Just plan FACTS.  He got 'em wrong.  So he either lies, is too dumb to know the facts or his staff is incompetent.

  If a neighbor lied to you about stuff you knew about..would you trust them?  Of course not.  So how do we deal with Trump who is caught lying...like this am about Comey and classified stuff....which he didn't release."

No other demographic in America or modern history has been subject to that unspeakable tyranny and inhumanity.

But it didn't end with slavery. Slaves also had ""free"" offspring and subsequent descendants who were subject to over a century and a half of anti-black discrimination, marginalization, exclusion, and terrorism.

For Morneau to have made use of tax loop holes that only the richest would use, and not propose legislation that would close these loop holes is disgusting?  Is it because he wouldn't have any friends anymore?"
"While I don't disagree with what you are saying what do you think we could personally do to keep the jobs here?  Reality is our thoughts are worth nothing.

"The pope, while certainly capable of the occasional ill-advised ad lib, is still protected by an institution with centuries of experience in diplomatic nuance. Nobody need worry about a gaffe coming from a meeting orchestrated by the Vatican Secretariat of State. 

Trump, on the other hand, is the leader of the gang that couldn't shoot straight. His administration can't get through a morning, let alone a whole day, without two or three juicy diplomatic snafus. And, unlike the pope, Trump's spontaneous comments are almost always unkind and self-serving.

So, if a diplomatic flare-up results from this meeting, you can bet your bottom dollar that the one responsible will be the guy with the comb-over, not the one with the beanie."

"Whoever thinks this should have been handled differently, please explain how and why. Put yourself in the troopers driver seat. What would you do when you exited the car and confronted the man you just had a pursuit with not knowing if he had any weapons on him? Remember you have no backup. 
You can b*tch all you want and say, ""the trooper broke the guys clavicle and fractured his rib."" Really?! That idiot did it to himself. None of this would have happened if he didn't flee from the cop. He could have easily killed himself or even killed someone else for his stupid actions. Lots of lives are put at risk in these situations. This isn't a pursuit in a ""movie"". 
You can play the ""cop needs to keep his emotions in check card"" all you want. Reality is though, they are human just like you and I. I'm sure this trooper has seen some bad wrecks in 22 years. You try keeping your emotions in check when you see a young boy/girl dead due to someone's actions like this."

"I was perplexed on Dec. 1 when a composting pail showed up on my porch with an amount of paperwork equal to the weight of the pail.  Then, I became annoyed, followed by mad as hell.  I do not want smelly garbage under my sink.  I do not want to maintain another #%! recycling container.  I especially am rankled by the notion of Mandatory Bin Monitoring (a typical heavy-handed gov't. approach) done by folks who will peer through my yard debris can in order to rate my compliance.  I don't think so!  My yard debris container is private property, as is everything in it.  Keep out!!  

I have experienced the smell of sour, rotten garbage that permeated neighborhoods in Portland during its composting phase.  You don't want it, trust me: How to ruin a nice summer day by opening a door or window.

"Tempmaona, what makes me think that is the actual situation that occurred with the San Bernardino terrorists attack in December 2015 in which 14 people were killed by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik.  Farook first met her online and had one in-person meeting before petitioning to bring her to the U.S. to get married. She entered under the K-1 visa program for fiancs. Was she properly vetted? The State Department said she was thoroughly vetted and asked such questions as ""Do you seek to engage in terrorist activity?"" and ""Are you a member of a terrorist organization?""  No terrorist worth his or her salt would answer yes.  Farook was able to bring in a fianc who he married and together committed a horrendous terrorist attack.  It is nave to believe that other terrorists cant do it."

"What do you do if the rules become intolerable? The history of the world is full of dictators who were elected (Hitler, Marcos, Musollini). Were their rules to be followed? The world is full of laws that are unjust (stoning homosexuals, child marriage, death for apostasy). But America is different I hear you say. In a way, it is. The founding fathers of this country believed that if there did not exist a moralistic culture within the country that the laws wouldn't matter. 

My point is that we are in the decline phase of our culture and civilization therefore the laws that are being made are equally immoral and unjust."

Think again Nixon brought in the voters that were disgusted that the Democrats brought to the table like the KKK, Jim Crow in the south. Yes, they were religious and yes they were conservative as far as racist or anti-Constitution you are wrong. 
A hallmark of the Conservative agenda is preserving the Constitution, something the Democrats have tried to dismantle ever since it was written.

"BS.

Trump himself said he fired him because of the ""Russian thing"", and the circumstances leading up to his dismissal (seeking his personal loyalty, asking him to lay off Flynn) leave little doubt.  

Earlier  efforts to say Trump fired him on the deputy AG's recommendation were denied by the deputy AG. 

Saying Trump fired Comey because he was unfair to Clinton during the election is just plain laughable."
"Nice try but Mulroney had already announced his retirement and the money was for work following his term as an MP.  He was not in a position to influence the government of Kim Campbell or the following government Jean Chretien.  
You Liberals are always trying to distort the facts.
Nothing can erase the stink of Trudeau as a MP accepting fees from charities for speaking engagements nor accessing cash for access.  The fact is, Trudeau is either not bright enough to see the conflict of interest or is so egotistical that he thinks rules don't apply to him."
"""....Donald Trump later explain that he hadnt ordered Flynn to do this, but that he would have ordered him to do it, if he hadnt,,, already done so.

"At best, these potential slaves were bound for factory work (with low pay and poor conditions), as likely, work in fields and at worst work in the drug trade or prostitution (likely catering to undocumented migrants). My bet is that the person who is buying these people likes immigration law exactly the way it is, with a compliant workforce that can be deported if it demands humanity and a local sheriff that will track down runaways (undocumented migrants dont get cars). At the heart, the problem is not immigration. It is capitalism. The driver knows who he was delivering to and who hired him. Getting the information from him should be no problem.

The Texas Catholic Conference is pathetic. To sell out immigrants for school cholice and abortion provisions (that likely will be overtruned) shows how much they are in the pocket of the Republican Party. The USCCB is as pathetic, but that is because Archbishop Kurtz is an arch-Republican. That is outrageous."

POTUS did not win the popular vote and seems bend on just undoing what ever he can the transpired during Obama's term.  He was not elected to do that.  He should explore the will of the people more  than a headline opportunity and a photo op.  A corporate power broker does not qualify one to lead a nation.

You scoff at the police enforcement of this law and holding the father accountable for child endangerment because of the very few facts given.  There could be, and likely is much more to this story.  Regardless of your bias and anti police comments, they have a duty to act on behalf of the child.  It's not SPD' s fault this happened, nor is SPD responsible for the way the law is written, it's their sole job to enforce the law and present the case to the prosecutor.

What would be 'stupid' would be to pay more taxes than I owe based on the laws applicable to me.

Trump isn't 'stupid', either.

Her alleged actions are especially deplorable because we live in a society in which fathers frequently do not fulfill their responsibilities. Weaponizing a supposed pregnancy undermines other women who are actually pregnant and need help from the fathers, to say nothing of what it does to the victim.

I suspect Marshall doesn't have two nickels to rub together, but if nothing else, she will endure the stress and expense of defending herself against the civil suit. Maybe it'll make her think twice the next time she decides to mess with someone's head."

The MSM reports on what Trump has said or has tweeted and also gives the various Trump surrogates to trumpet (sorry could not resist ;) and interpret the President's words. 

All of the MSM is reporting fake news is the explanation for reporting on Trump put forth by the Trump supporters.  What is the simplest explanation for the MSM reporting the same things about Trump? This is explained by

2) The news as reported, is true.

 What a sad way to look at human drives that motivate discovery,  achievement, aspirations, and physical intimacy. Have you not experienced--then subsequently sought to oft-repeat--the gratification of achievement, of discovery, of rigor paying off? 

Heck, you even assign ""gratification"" a pejorative status. 

Human passions and human appetites are not of lesser animals, they often are examples of the gifts we have to extend our capacities to become optimal children of God and lovers of other humans.

"OPB August 26, 2016 

Governor Kate Brown:  ""But she also disagreed with sponsors of the measure, who have contended that the major corporations subject to the tax would not be able to pass it on to consumers.

Oregonians are smart enough to realize there will be, um, they will bear some of these increased costs, Brown said. She did not say what share she thought would be passed on to consumers, noting that economists have differed on that.""

"" The Legislative Revenue Office has estimated that the measure would eventually cost Oregon households between $372 and $1,282 a year, depending on their income level. Most of that would be in higher prices, although some would represent lost wages."" 
 
""Paul Warner, the chief revenue officer, said he estimates that about half the tax hike would be passed on to consumers."""
"Trump wishes Comey good luck? Why does he need luck he is just being asked to state what was said. It is the investigative committee that will take the statement and combine it with whatever other information they have and then consider whether to impeach or explore other options. As for who's word will be believed, Comey is the more reputable of the two but the Trumphiles have earplugs, blinders and nose plugs on."
"Good luck with that.  /s

Don't forget the big $$ he ""earned"" (no doubt for nothing other than being the spawn of a prominent U.S. Senator) off the Special Olympics, Alaska hosted, some years ago.  $700k is the figure I heard mentioned. Not bad from a non-profit organization relying on ""volunteers"".  Nonetheless, don't count him out.  The Alaska Republican Party is corrupt to the core. Its ""leadership"" will handicap all but the chosen candidate.  We've seen it before."
"Come on damn it.  Hillary wasn't the best choice for the Democrats and I'm a liberal.  She never really had an economic plan other than chirping in her campaign stump, ""I'm going to turn the economy over to Bill.""  Geez.  Give me a back flipping break."
"Thanks for stating the obvious. Of course ANWR is federal land. So is a significant chunk of Alaska given all the national wildlife refuges, parks, BLM lands, etc. If each state Outside had the same proportion of land owned by the feds in their states, I expect Outsiders would also be as frustrated as Alaskans are. But of course, Outsiders think Alaska is one big national park, don't live here, and don't struggle for work here. As for Yellowstone, let the locals and the state of Wyoming decide if its worth more to them as a national park or a source of natural renewable energy source."
"Layla4, you are correct to the extent that Human Rights Codes do not prohibit or restrict stupid or unfair hiring decisions - only ones where the employer has a prohibited motive.  Examples are where the employer refused to hire because the applicant black, jewish, muslim, christian, disabled, for instance.  

In those cases, the employer will still be in the right if he can establish a bona fide occupational requirement for the decision.

Complainants lose the overwhelming majority of human rights hearings, by the way."
"I don't believe that Hillary would ever go to war against Islam, radical or otherwise. She will follow Obama in bringing Islam to this country for control of it, lock, stock and barrel. Assimilating into American society is not on their agenda now nor was it ever. Religions have been at war since their inception and that will never change. Community and even country, have nothing to do with it. It's just all a bunch of madness that's always been."
I can see you're ignorant about ANSCA especially if you belong to a regional or village corporation or both.  I can do my math very well and it's sitting in my bank account.

"High Cost of Ignorance"" Toronto Sun, Editorial page article about Greg Vezina, Oct. 23, 2016

Green energy entrepreneur Greg Vezina says its no surprise the Ontario Liberal governments experiment with green energy has turned into an expensive debacle.

Here are links to editorial page articles I have written in the Toronto Sun in the last two years.

"I have read it a million times that Trumps voters are racists, ignorant and sexists.  It is standard leftist lingo when they describe anyone with a viewpoint that challenges their own.  Calling out liars, who have been demeaning ordinary Americans without a political champion to stand up for them, has made Trump their hero.  I often disagree with the President but I love the way he fights the left.  They are mud throwers and Trump knows how to push their faces flat into the mire."
Trudeau has the character to back away from a promise if it does not seem to be desired by the population. Trump just proved that following through on a promise for the sake of it being a promise (in politics). Is rather stupid.
"Taiwan is an independent and democratic country. They should not need to stand under the shadow of the Chinese Communist Party. The world should recognize Taiwan for what it is and has been: a democratic, peaceful, productive country.

No bullying from China should change the world's support for Taiwan."
"I find it very sad that a grown man would disparage others for pursuing what interests them, and suggest they are dumb because of it."
She said London and New York have an awful lot in common.  That is right. They both are crime riddled and are neck in neck to see which is the most dangerous.  London recently obtained that honor.

"The time to start is now; there is so much fake nonsense on the net. 
Justin Trudeau is a constant target of outright lies and fake news."
"No, I've never said TS or CJ gets a pass because of the OL. In fact, I've stated several times that both the pass and run games were hampered by the poor OL performance. The OL problem has been addressed this offseason and the hope is that both the run and the pass will improve because of the changes... although both have yet to be proven in regular season. The difference is, you've repeatedly stated that TS is below average and won't be any better. I disagree and that seems to bother you a lot."
"I support you senator Sullivan,  you did what you said.
I think you're a traitor senator murkowski"
"Yes, you are. You are a sucker for every idiotic conspiracy notion that comes across the internet. A PhD candidate forever. I'm not a sucker, but you definitely are. Just a word to the wise, so I suppose it won't penetrate through your dense skull."
he should step down if he can't do his job.
"Well, nobody except a pile of radical eco leftists could come up with something so stupid as the Green Energy Act.  To paraphrase the Auditor General, it was as if the government (Liberal Party) ignored all advice from the government employees and moved forward with their own ideas (i.e. Gerald Butts)
BTW, when the Minister talks about rebuilding the infrastructure we know that it was a relatively minor expense.  As for closing coal plants, the Fraser institute proved that was nonsense by quoting the Liberals own research.  The biggest benefit came from closing the coal plants in the Ohio Valley which were responsible for 50% to 90% of Ontario's smog (depending on were one lived)."
"More examples of ""helping"".

-  Access to B12 formula that works

-  Ah!  But someone makes sure she lives in a place that is so toxic with radiation that it will damage the B12 and cause MORE problems.   (B12 is formed around a cobalt ring, which is metal.  B12 is the ONLY vitamin with stable metal-carbon bonds in it -- a clue to its importance.   The metal in the vitamin is vulnerable to radiation.)

"We may disagree to some extent I think. Nothing is incumbent on God, but he can't help but make us feel loved once we get that he's there and start acting like it.  That's who He is. Our duty is to make disciples of all nations by helping others to do the same. See Evangelii Gaudium."
"Trump's approval rating continues to fail at historical lows.

Rattling his sword is just a shallow ploy to try to boost his worst ever ratings.

He also just announced expansion of the Afghan War hoping some Fox newscaster would swoon and whisper sweet nothings in his demented ear.

Mentally unbalanced buffoonery is no substitute for actual national security."
"You can have the cake and eat it too. You can't have Buffet's backing without the diluting effect of his stakes. Man, HCG's shareholders are really greedy. I have no sympathy for them. 

I have sold my shares. Can't live with these losers."
"This is only the second time ever I have somewhat agreed with our twit of a PM.

The other was celebrating the record sniper shot.

Everything else that spills out of his tiny brain is cynical double-speak supplied by Gerald Butts.

Canada deserves better and should never have replaced Harper. Boring competence is an admirable virtue rather than all this expensive glitzy idiocy we now have."
Those people need to be sent back to their home planet.
Mateen killed those 50 gay people and shot  another 50 for the glory of Allah.
"We have elected a president with no moral center.  While we would all agree that violence is ill-advised, he misses the point entirely.  The point being that the White Supremes started it, incited it, and seek to maintain it and Trump is supporting their position.  I would prefer to see the counter-protesters standing off to the side and laughing at the ridiculousness of these very primitive human beings."
The poster is so wrong? What is a misuse of taxpayer money is the 458 million Harper spent on losing forced legal appeals to the Supreme Court! If we had mandatory voting I could understand no party subsidies. But until every eligible voters vote that is not cast does not automatically go to the party that gets the most votes we are at risk of more Harper's!
"I sampled at least a half gram of 99 different strains (blind) in April (3-5 per day, every day) in the lead up to Cultivation Classic on April 30.

"""Divorce is so much more prevalent among people with less education and less money,"" said Julie Hanlon Rubio, a professor of Christian ethics at St. Louis University. ""That's not a virtue issue; it's just easier to maintain a marriage and have a family when you have money and everything that comes with money.""

The only woman who ever asked me to marry her said never even mentioned love.  She said, ""My dad will give us a lot of money if we get married.""   Historically, marriage is an economic bargain more than a love match.  For many it still is."

He was coddled and got off lightly considering his over the  top egregious behavior.  Although I have to surmise that he is hero to that racist trump.
"B.S.... American arogance! Syria is a soverign country... get out american hypocrites... you,re not invited!"
One more brick in the wall of Republican terrorist tyranny deemed acceptable by the Trump appointed occupiers of the fetid swamp containing the worst traitors since Benedict Arnold.  Time for a Revolution.
"Those of us who voted for Dumb Trump were forced to because we didn't want a  lying career criminal in the White House. Now we have this moron who is attempting to poison our air, water, and food because he isn't smart enough to know he and his children/grandchildren will be also. All this to cater to his billionaire buddies."
What a thoroughly asinine statement.  You really are a nut.
"Are you Catholic?  It seems to me a bit ridiculous to assume that most people's problems with Hillary have to do with her being a ""woman"".  It is far more likely that others have the same problems I do:  Lying, deceit, criminal activity, indifference, self-serving behaviors.  She supports KILLING BABIES.  That is a major disqualifier for Catholics, of much greater importance than her position on the environment or immigration.  She lied to congress.   She tampered with evidence.  She made back room deals, not to pass a political agenda but to commit crimes.  She left Americans to die in foreign countries.  She stole money with her so-called ""charitable foundation"".  She is everything bad and evil -- unethical politicians all wrapped up into one.  She is blatantly anti-catholic.  Anyone who supports her necessarily supports her behaviors and activities.  I would much rather support someone with a history of stupid locker room talk than someone with evil criminal/murderous intent."
Looks more like an anti Trump protest.

"Your right, I should drop the poor people thing and make my argument simpler. It's a stupid ordinance crafted to benefit people who are overly emotionally invested in their dogs and those who can't tolerate a fractional amount of chaos for a couple hours, a few days a year. Two hundred and fifty dollars is a ridiculous amount to fine people over it. One thousand dollars is absolutely insane! I am glad people violate it and I am glad that it pisses people off. I am glad my views upset you. Anyone who supports his law should have their tails ruffled by people like me every time it is mentioned as you support people being fined for your marginal discomfort!"

"Harper may have been a sob but he was our sob. He ran the show and his ministers did as he instructed. If you screwed up he called in the RCMP for an investigation.

"A nice, warm, fuzzy, feel-good story for a change. Maybe there's hope for humanity yet?"
Like the 6 murders committed by the white boy finally caught last month?
"You raise a most interesting point.  When the US soldiers were killed, they had already declared war on Afghanistan.  Yes, it is sad the soldiers died but they were there because they enlisted in the US military and the US had declared war.  How so many people seem to think that a soldier fighting for his country in a  war zone is entitled to civil compensation in this case boggles the mind.  Very clearly the US government can't support the lawsuit because that would open up the can of worms where US soldiers could be sued for their actions during war. The US opposed the International Criminal Court because they did not want their soldiers subject to judicial processes outside of the US."
"As I keep saying, you can't fix stupid."
"Stupid and myopic responce mr educated. I love how you guys just dismiss any responce you chose not to agree with so you don't have to think up an answer.

Following the next Alberta election in 2019, the county will finally be rid of this NDP blight."
"That stench of corruption you all smell is a slimy, goo like trail that leads straight to Kathleen Wynne's office at Queen's Park.

"Hold the 100 members of Congress accountable who affirmed Shulkin as Secretary. Do so in the midterm elections and hold Trump accountable also. He has no more allegiance to Vets than Obama did. Rubio sponsored the additional power assigned to Shulkin in terms of the Accountability Act and WhIstleblower protections, but he did so with no follow-up so he can't assess or does not want to assess Shulkin's repeated abuses. McCain also affirmed Shulkin knowing he lied to the media and to Senator McCain about Phoenix. Shulkin's performance is a c-rated Op-Ed to make the public believe he has substance. Veterans are still languishing in their feces, being denied care, overdosed on opioids and having their claims delayed and denied while their compensation is embezzeled. Where is the justice in this and where is the compassion ? As practitioners careers are destroyed by Shulkin for reporting wrongdoing and whistleblowers are blatantly retaliated against, no improvement will occur."
"Next thing you know, they'll be trying to put lead back in gasoline. Yeah not so smart Trump. Your gonna slowly kill off the voters who got you elected."
"It's an official US policy that targets a single religion. This isn't about prohibiting free religion; as I said, this is about ESTABLISHMENT of law or policy that either favors or targets a particular religion. It isn't fuzzy at all, frankly.

"You obviously have an ax to grind. Yes, I know my Church history."
"So, sports fans, it looks like after achieving a victory, more or less, in the preliminary rounds in the Syrian civil war, Iran and Hezbollah are moving on in the Middle East Cup playoffs to face their next opponent, Saudi Arabia.  We haven't seen the injury report yet but we can assume that they will still have to rely on substitutions from their affiliate Russian team to provide adequate manpower.  The Russians provided good replacements in the previous round, but league rules it seems may prevent them from participating in the next round of playoffs.  If that is the case, what minor league team can provide Iran and Hezbollah with the replacements - Iraq (still too bogged down in their own battles), ISIS (major disagreements in management style), Turkey (good on paper but questionable on the field of play), Kurds (definitely not).  Stay tuned as we follow all the action on the Mideast Sports Network!"
"Your first sentence is so laughably false I couldn't be bothered to read the rest. Britain isn't even the last monarchy in Europe, not even close to the last one in the world and the current form of government use by the British isn't even close to that which we revolted from."
"I trust the city reminded Pilot that 20% of the parking spaces have to have tree shade per their rules. They told me they could make no exceptions.  I assume they will not make any for Pilot.  Or are they more interested in the $376, 830 they reap from the 106 new peak hour trips? Or is it the $344,000 for the water hook-up? Or maybe the 5% of the value of the project finished project?  All of the above is closer to reality. Its funny how they cater to big money, but pillage small business up front with no assistance or leeway.   I will watch the development to be sure to hold them accountable to the same rules they had for my project.

I wonder how one would move those big rigs through all those trees?"
"He's been compared to Hitler several times in these responses.  He's been called a narcissist, bigot, racist, and ""ugly human being"", etc. do you really need me to internet for you?  Scroll through the posts that I was referring to and it's clear.  So now, specifically, what is it that he's done that made him any of these things.  Narcissistic?  Perhaps.  Ugly is subjective and frankly it's the kind of judgmental insult that an ""ugly human being"" would probably sling at others.  Bigot? Take a look around, does this seem tolerant of other's views?  Racist?  For what?  Wanting to screen immigrants more effectively and keep criminals out of our country? How dare him, right?

So, specifically, what is it that's he's done that has made him a racist, a bigot, and comparable to Hitler?  I've just gone through every post here again, looking for specifics, and they're not here. 

And FWIW, I'm glad you were ""shocked"" by the truth.  I'm willing to bet that happens a lot!"

He's a Harvard professor (don't all you education hating right wingers hate smart people) who only does defense work.  Of course he talks about how he would defend the case.

Now, THAT is dystopian."

"Father, you may be missing the big picture.

Whether you call it welfare or income or naked bribery or vote pandering, the reason for this pilot project now is the next election is just a year away, the premier is at 11% in the polls, her party is well behind the PCs and NDP so it is ""all hands on deck"" or rather ""all dollars on deck"" to bribe the most vulnerable to vote Liberal yet again.

The calculation is inasmuch as 14 years of the Liberals have resulted in Ontario being the most indebted sub-sovereign jurisdiction on the planet as well as among the highest taxed jurisdictions in North America and yet the voters keep re-electing the them it is OK to offer this latest bribe because higher debt and taxes are of such little concern to Ontarians.

Its not Wynne's fault if Ontario voters seem to be political and financial masochists susceptible to naked bribes.

Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, fool me 3 times and I probably shouldn't be able to vote."

"Why do we have to pay out $3 billion a year to countries like China and India who have until 2030 to meet their obligations?  Iran and North Korea are part of the Paris Accord.  Any agreement which they are a part of is enough reason to stay away from it.  The money train is coming to a stop.  The stupid, rich kid, just got a whole lot smarter."
"North Korea is a joke of a country. The horrors that government inflicts on the poor people that actually have to live there are intolerable. It seems even China has grown weary of Lil' Kim's antics.

However, North Korea does have some bite. They have demonstrated chemical and nuclear capabilities.  One of the risks of a nuke going off, even a lousy one, is the electromagnetic pulse it gives off. Set one off in the right area, and it cooks the electrical grid. Some very important parts to the grid take a year to build, and they don't have shelves of them in stock. The problem with fighting a crazy person, is that they are completely nuts, and they fight can end up in a very dark place.

The question I don't see asked a lot is how crazy is Kim Jong Un, and does he believe his own B.S?"

You can bet that every single time Orange alleged that the election was rigged, that what was in his mind was the rigging that he was doing. Same idea for ""crooked hillary"" and the lock her up line. 

This should be fun."
The attempted parallel is so ridiculous that it falls flat on its face.

One was a wolf-hybrid (which is illegal to own without a permit) that ganged up with another dog or wolf-hybrid to hamstring a cow moose in the middle of the night. I had to shoot the moose because she couldn't stand up. They next morning I shot the wolf-hybrid, which was feeding on the moose. The other instance was a rottweiler and a pitbull that were attacking a cow moose and her young calf. A person on scene had been trying to chase the dogs away unsuccessfully. The cow was bleeding from multiple bites. The person on scene knew where the owner lived. The owner was not home.  His dogs had broken loose before and threatened the neighbors. I shot both dogs when they returned to attack the two moose. I think I did a good thing. And to respond to your second flagrant lie, I don't enjoy shooting animals and I don't want to be the one who shoots feral cats."

"There was no sin committed by the vast majority of people involved, who were devoted and well-meaning. 

There was by SOME, but other people cannot apologize for other peoples' sin, they can only do what the Pope has done, expressed regret, sympathy, etc.

As for LBGTQ, apologizing for the fact that moral standards in the past were different from modern ones is silly.

Expecting everyone to accept the very latest version of what the western world considers ""right"", right this minute, or else be deemed irredeemably evil, is just as much an expression of western moral and cultural superiority as the evangelical, puritanical missionaries of the past, and so quite hypocritical."
"It's one thing for people to not like Hillary Clinton's politics or to feel she's had her turn.
But my mind boggles when people say they voted for Donald Trump because Hillary Clinton lacks character or she lies.
Donald Trump has character? Since when?
Trump can lie, cheat and steal with the worst.
And ""family values"", ""moral responsibility"" religious conservatives are the worst hypocrites. Trump has no moral center, period. He has been divorced twice and married three times, he makes money off of gambling, he has boasted about his sexual conquests, he routinely denigrates women, and before he started campaigning, the only time he ever entered a church was to get out of the rain or duck a subpoena process server.
But, he doesn't drink alcoholic drinks and will throw GLBT people under the bus whenever he needs to, so religious conservatives swoon."

"Actually it's on all those Americans who think a presidential election is a popularity contest.

"DG, I have learned that issues like this one are prone to provoke vigorous response based on personal worldview.   Nevertheless, I am concerned about how we resolve matters when the entire case turns on what two people say without evidence of any other kind.  This may not trouble you, but I have observed that some people can be so bitter and hateful that they will stoop to virtually anything to hurt the party they despise.   In cases like this one, there are two humans involved.  The lives of both have value.  We must be careful so as not to do more damage than good."

"If you want ALL schools to compete for kids, then ALL schools should have the right to reject any that don't belong in the school.

No one competing for your kid?  Tough tinsel.  Homeschooling would appear to be a good option.  Don't have the time or ability to homeschool your kid?  Then you should have made better choices.

Now, you might think the product is the education.  It isn't.  The final product is the educated human being.

I worked in a plant that made portable light towers for about 9 months.  It would have been tough to make a tough, rugged, steel light tower with aluminum foil and crepe paper.  We rejected substandard material in order to produce a quality product.

If you want true choice and competition, then this is the only acceptable way.  Anything short of this is just you, Betsy DeVos, and others of like mind wanted to funnel money away from public schools to church schools for political purposes....nothing more.

How's this for choice and competition?"

You are absolutely right.  Bishop Paprocki is orthodox Catholic.  And that is the problem.  Bishop Paprocki exorcised a whole state.

"A lot of world leaders are not worthy of a eulogy but they always get one.  A recent example is former Israeli  PM Ariel Sharon who as an IDF General in the 1980, presided over the Sabra and Shatilla massacres and was found personally responsible for the massacre by the Israeli Kahan Commission..  As PM he  presided over accelerated illegal settlement building and was  responsible for brutal repression and reprisals on Palestinians who fought against confiscation of their land..  The statement from the PMs office upon his death described him as ""Mr. Sharon demonstrated resilience throughout his life, but he was also a man who recognised that military solutions were insufficient to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."""

While I appreciate the advice on reducing my RRSP before OAS and CPP kick in (or deferring the startup of either or both) it is still not clear to me whether I must convert my RRSP to a RRIF to begin reducing it or what advantage there is to establishing a RRIF at age 60 vs just taking money out of my RRSP annually to reduce it and then converting it to a RRIF at 71. It seems a RRIF is a bit constraining at age 60..

That said, what is referred to as mass killings in this country pale when compared to the mass killings and genocides going on all over the world.

What these sand rats are using are not ""assault rifles"" no matter how many times you say it, it will never be true. Do we have assault pistols?

"Exchange Income Corp reports non-IFRS compliant ""free cash flow"" to show a reasonable payout ratio. However, every company must funds its growth capex, partially from its retained cash flow (equity) and new debt, assuming they keep their debt/equity ratios flat. With this as a background, payout ratios are higher than 100%. To make things worse, company considers reduction in working capital as a ""sustainable"" source of cash to fund distributions. A growing company doesn't reduce its working capital and fund distributions. Current distributions are not sustainable -company is  issuing equity from time to time, raising debt levels to fund its growth plans and maintaining high distributions."

"Trump probably doesn't know about it yet, let's wait for a late night tweet."
"What did a semen-stained blue dress from the Oval Office have to do with a land deal in Arkansas? After a couple of years of digging, that's all a partisan prosecutor could find against Bill Clinton. 
There's nothing unconstitutional about a prosecutor working an investigation finding evidence of other, related or even unrelated crimes. And of course, it's constitutional to pursue those other crimes. 
Watergate started as the investigation of a burglary and led to related crimes that brought Nixon down. 
Say a judge signs a search warrant based on evidence of an illegal poker game in Joe's basement. The cops come in and find they're not gambling, but there is an ounce of cocaine on the card table. Do they walk out and say: ""Darn, too bad the warrant's for illegal gambling. Now we can't make a case for the cocaine.""
Same as a prosecutor investigating MAFIA underlings to build a RICO case against the mob boss. She may use a drug case as a means of gaining cooperation."
"We're all transfixed by our screens, constantly, even me as I write this.  Old-school  ""reality"" just doesn't register with us as vividly any more, it's just background noise lots of the time."

"They were playing hurt because of hits that were late, from behind, and completely illegal.
If Perry ever wins the Cup, how proud he will be of having run over goalies on purpose, again and again??  How proud will Kesler be of trying to break McDavid's wrist on every shift?  Or Getzlaf with a late and dirty hit on the far smaller Sekera??  Edmonton should have had 20 power plays.   This is like being back in 1974, watching the dirty Broad Street Bullies goon their way to two cups.  The NHL wanted one of the expansion teams to be competitive, and by allowing this sort of crap they got what they wanted.  
As someone else here mentioned, the NHL is getting to be like the NBA - the fix is most definitely in.  Maybe they should notice that the NFL has the best, least biased officiating, and is the $ king of sports.  Fans want to see if the young can beat the old, small market beat big, etc., without such crookedness!"
There is no doubt in my mind that the Liberals are peddling influence. I thought they might have distanced themselves from the corrupt cabal that ran the 'adscam' fraud during the Chretien regime but it appears not.

This forum muzzles any true form of free speech. Yes, I know there are troglodytes that will abuse it. So, a few bad apples and then you take away the chance for any true freeform conversation. Because of this new forum, several of my comments, which weren't horrible, get banned due to the thin skinned sensibility of some of the people that use this.

No conversation can be pure when people are disallowed from speaking freely, regardless of how unfounded or vitriolic.

""He now works a 40-hour week at $17 an hour, the result of a union contract two years ago. He says the pay increase has changed his lifestyle dramatically. He now helps support his girlfriend and her two kids, has moved out of his parents house and rents a Toronto apartment for $2000 a month. He is paying off the remaining $2000 on his OSAP loan and saving $200 a month for emergencies. And he has a few dollars at the end of the month to donate to a local youth shelter.""

So he is making extra $3 /hr, or $3 x 40 hours x 52 weeks = $6,240 a year or $520 a month, he is now suddenly able to rent a $2,000 Apt, help to support 3 other people , paying off debt and saving? Wow, how is the math works out ?"

"You have to move past the perception that small and limited government is tied to Republicans or those you accuse of being conservative. Let me explain to you. The GOP is not conservative. Conservative is not in anyway affiliated with religion or whatever might motivat one to take up the argument of contraception or abortion. So in that I say you are either a fool or misguided. I will also say this, we are not all fooled by the conception that the GOP is conservative. History tells a different story. 

You my friend are completely misguided. A small and limited government would not infringe on the rights of the people. If you so choose to murder your unborn child, a true conservative would not infringe on your right through the government. 

Let me add this since you so ignorantly brought the concept of abortion and contraceptive into the conversation. 50% of all children aborted are women. What say you about the rights of all of these children and what say you about women's rights."
"Clearly judges will use their discretion. But why should they have to? The law should give judges some guidance to the relative gravity of the crime. Equating it to aggravated assault of a police officer is over reaching.

"If the we are gauging the success of increased student attendance as a goal for Coach Rolovich and Team, then the opening home game would as a moderate success (22, 275).  I believe the attendance number was ticket count vs. turnstile count(?)  However, as bleedgreen indicated the addressing of rowdy behavior and acquiescing to same will still keep the other half (20, 000+)  away.  As a former season ticket holder, I personally do not want to subject my grandkids or guests to the type of behavior mentioned in the article...so we just don't go.  Would I go to a game...might but perhaps.  Coach should reach out the the non-student population.

"Obama was a great role model.  Not only for African-Americans but for anyone that was born on first base.  He rose up from noting to win the most powerful office in the world.  However, he was a weak and divisive leader.  Something many in the press could not see due to his 'historic' significance.  Trump on the other hand was born on third base and is an absolutely terrible role model.  Whether or not he becomes a great leader remains to be seen."
"The last time Clinton had a double digit lead was in August and in the final week most showed her 2-4 points ahead while with Brexit the polls showed both sides tied, it was the betting agencies and markets who got it wrong as they assumed the 10% who were undecided would break heavily in favour of the remain side.  By contrast, against Macron, polls show she is trailing by 20 points which is far greater than Brexit or Trump were trailing.  Now if Filion somehow makes the second round (polls are a lot tighter there) or Melenchon makes it (very little two way polling on those two) then you could get an upset, but unless Macron has some scandal or does something really stupid seems unlikely she would beat him."

That's the right way to encourage investment and get away from our now government funded economy!!    Not one Legislative member much less our Governor has a idea for using our resources to create New Wealth. They all  like the easy way out by Taxing the people in a down economy  what FOOLS.

"About 30 years ago I gave evidence at an inquest into the death of Lester Donaldson, a mentally-ill man who was shot by police. The jury came out with the same recommendations that have been repeated by every jury since then, yet the deaths are still happening. What we are doing is simply not working. 
The one common factor with all of these deaths is that the person involved has either refused treatment or has stopped medication. As any relative of a person suffering from schizophrenia can tell you, people with a serious mental illness often have no insight into their illness and do not believe that they are ill. Yet they are allowed to make medical decisions on the false assumption that they are competent. 
A way must be found to treat people before they become so agitated and confused that they become violent. Unfortunately our society is so hung up on individual rights above all else that the mentally-ill are allowed to destroy themselves rather than submit to treatment."

Would the families of those fallen protest if you called for removal of the Vietnam War Memorial? Lincoln himself was racist, and said if he could preserve the union without freeing the slaves he would do so. He wanted to send all blacks back to Africa. So should be remove all monuments to Lincoln? History often is half-toned, not black & white, so to speak.

"In order to win the Conservatives need to do two things.  Might not work in 2019 as one term governments are rare but best to follow this.  Will they, probably not.

1.  Find Trudeau's weak spots and relentlessly go after him.  One stupid mistake doesn't bring down a government, but a repeated pattern of errors does so I would focus on excessive spending with no controls, otherwise out of control deficits which will mean higher taxes or spending cuts long term.

2.  Have an appealing platform.  I would recommend Scheer take some of the other candidates good ideas like O'Toole's generation kickstart, Chong's revenue neutral carbon tax, Raitt's policy to deal with mental health, Alexander on homelessness, and Saxton on where to cut to balance the budget.  Scheer had little in ideas but many others did.  Many were only pandered to the base but some as mentioned above could be appealing to swing voters."

Also not reflected in the editorial is historical fact:  in 1973, two days before a moratorium was set to take effect on commercial aquarium collecting, a deal was struck allowing the aquarium trade to continue with ""more studies"" needed to determine the effects of taking limitless numbers of reef fish. In 2004 DLNR studied catch reports and documented the collapse of the aquarium fishery (their words) on SW Oahu reefs after the effects of hurricanes Iwa and Iniki combined with over-collecting to wipe out reef fish populations. Despite a fish bloom of ""biblical proportions"" that occurred in 2014 after an extreme warming anomaly, current yellow tang take is still far below 1984 levels, just after hurricane Iwa. The stalling tactic of ""more studies"" has been used for over 45 years. Those who promote it are doing a grave disservice to Hawaii's reefs and people."

"Some of the forgotten real story of how the Hokulea was conceived and built originally-
Ben Finney, Anthropologist Who Debunked Theory on Island Settlement, Dies at 83
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/us/ben-finney-dead-hawaii-tahiti.html?_r=0
.
With Herbert Kawainui Kane, an artist, and Tommy Holmes, a local waterman, Professor Finney founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society in 1973 to study traditional Polynesian techniques of sailing and navigation. In 1974, he and several colleagues, including David Lewis, a New Zealand anthropologist who was an expert on ancient Micronesian navigation methods, set about recreating a facsimile of the double-hulled canoes used in ancient Polynesia, assembling a mostly Hawaiian crew and taking the vessel on test runs around Hawaii.
.
If the navigation went according to plan, the voyage did not. The canoe confronted fierce storms and becalmed seas. Even worse, cultural tensions arose. The Hawaiian crew threatened to burn the boat."
"Wahoo, couldn't have said it better.  Corporations will do anything to reduce cost and increase market share.  If Budweiser really understood us they would improve their beer instead of spending so much on advertising.

More years ago than I care to remember, I loved beer, that wonderful bite of bitterness so perfect with a (real) hamburger-with-everything at the local tavern.  Then the manufacturers, led by Budweiser, started changing beer until it was 'beer', a thin and tasteless ghost of its former self.  The only way to get that remembered satisfaction was to buy imported.  Recently, when local crafters started producing robust beer with that great hops taste, we flocked to buy it.  Newer generations do it perhaps because the beer is delicious and trendy and a good way to meet people.  We older folk know it is a taste of our youth."

By that i mean that the more seriously we take the work of our lives, and the more seriously we try to enter into a deep understanding of it, the more our character can be formed by the diligence we apply to what we do.
It has been precisely my life-work that has given me a deep and practical sense of how we are called  to be Eucharist to one another in so many ways.

But the rape of boys by priests isn't 20%.    It's 80%.   Since the 1950s, 80% of the cases of child rape by priests were same sex attacks.

This can only mean that gay priests are far more likely to sexual predators of young people.   Heterosexually oriented priests, as a group, tend to be far less a risk to children."

"This is a digression from the topic, but I need to clarify your post. Legally, Canadians do need visas to enter the US. However, when a US Customs officer waves you in, you are deemed to have applied for, and been granted, a tourist visa. So while the bureaucratic process has been dispensed with, the legality of applying/granting a visa still remains, even though it may not be apparent to you. Further, the kind of visa you need depends on the purpose of your visit, and they are sticklers for making sure the two things match. If you are working or immigrating, you need actual visas in your passport, even as a Canadian. If you are going to study, you need the appropriate documents from your school, but no visa stamp. But there again, you are deemed to have applied for, and been granted a student visa, as you enter. Hope that helps."

But they were abandoned when they no longer made economic sense.  Now a third Knik Arm docking infrastructure, Port Mac, needs to be abandoned, because it makes absolutely no economic sense.

"Looks like there is no escaping the cultural Marxist brainwashing even to just watch a football game. I guess the idea that America has the right to control its own borders is crazy, right? In 1924 the USA virtually shut down all immigration (almost all of it from Europe btw,) to begin the enormous job of assimilating all the Ellis island arrivals and their descendants. The world never said a peep. America's borders were virtually sealed off until 1965. The only exception were about one million 'war brides' after WW2."

"In FPTP, Apathy at the riding level also drives apathy at the larger level.  People persuaded not to vote for Hillary are much more likely not to vote at all - for Congress, Senate, or school trustee.

FPTP is also prone to gerrymandering in the first place, which drives apathy, too.

While these activities are expensive, none of it is tracked or regulated, particularly where the social media interaction is either subliminal, or not overtly political.

Much of the danger in manipulation of social media lies in psychological conditioning 24/7/365.  It is about continuously molding the pre-dispositions of voters.

The money involved is huge, and none of it is visible.  That is what gives the Oil Industry such enormous power in elections.

But the government of Russia (and China, and Israel, and the NRA, and, ... and, ... and) also devote huge resources to it.

This time, the Oil Industry was gazumped by the government of Russia in the Republican primaries - and was furious about it."
"Elect a moron, expect an asylum."
"I think I get it. The Senate GOP is mad that the Governor exercised his legal right to convene a special session. So even though everyone agrees that legislation from last May contained a drafting error, GOP Senators argue that the ""fix"" shouldn't be passed since it doesn't need to be now (despite what the special districts are saying about their lost revenue) and that big Ol' meany the Gov must not have a ""victory"" here... (sounds vaguely familiar to the national GOP strategy during Obama: don't fret about the policy argument, if the opposing political party wants it, we must oppose). Obviously, denying these special districts pot tax revenue (and the real harm it will do to budgets and services) is more about GOP petulance that Hick called them to the capitol, and not based on any logical or persuasive policy position. Got it. And, TABOR is a red hearing. It is now settled case law that tax policy that nets revenue beneath the constitutional limit does not need voter approval."
To suggest that Trump was all alone on climate change is a joke. Canada is not even close to meeting its targets and Trudeau's policies pretty much guarantee we won't. Compared to the European efforts and even China's we might as well have dropped out of the agreement too. Trudeau's comments about this point to major hypocrisy on his part and the Libs.
"In all fairness, there wasn't a lot in his speech that condemned the shooter's racism in what I saw was one sentence about halfway through.  And, a lot of the speech was about racism on blacks.  So, it was pretty much biased, but not to the subject of the funeral itself.

Obama did largely avoid pointing the finger directly at blacks who were either performing or calling for acts against whites.  And, the Dems/liberals kinda went along with it and protected him.  Kinda like how the Repubs/right are doing for Trump.  Trump is coming under much more criticism, and largely deserved since the idiot can't keep his stupid trap shut or, god forbid, actually say the right thing to begin with.

The problem are the various ""sides"" in our society.  If they mess up, they protect themselves and deflect.  None stand up and say, ""we're in the wrong and we need to clean up our act.""  Spineless."
"Where do you dig up this crap, Agirl, and why do you buy into it? Do you have a clue?

True, the segregationists in Congress and Southern state government were Democrats out of tradition, but they were called ""Dixiecrats"" to distinguish them from progressive Northern Democrats in the FDR mold. Lyndon Johnson was a Texas Dixiecrat and known bigot who nevertheless nurtured and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which killed Jim Crow, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which largely ended black voter disenfranchisement, primarily in the South. After 1964 and particularly after Lee Atwater's Southern Strategy got Reagan elected, Dixiecrats switched their party loyalty to Republican. Today their are very few Democrats in Southern state government.

Your revisionist history is garbage, crafted to lure the ignorant toward racial hatred by making progressivism out to be evil. You are on the side of bigotry."

It will remain about where it is for the next year, and will flatten out after the summer months.  The ""Trump effect"" is in full play, which may affect everything if it lasts.

And once again there will be some people from Canada there, who may or may not have set foot in Canada in the past few years, who, along with their relatives, will start screaming that ""not enough is being done to get them out of there!!""  And just like with Hurricane Irma, it will have been known for DAYS that a hurricane was on it's way.

You can say what you will about airlines overbooking in the expectation of passengers not showing up but that is part of the industry. Could they have handled it better by not letting people on the plane in the first place? Definitely. But I have no sympathy for this moron who acted like a three year old refusing to take his nap, and did everything but kick his feet and burst into tears. How does one get to be an adult of his age and not learn how to act like one? He should be charged and then banned for life from flying on United again. As for him being a doctor, I, for one, wouldn't want anything to do with a doctor with such horrible judgement and immaturity."
"The bigger problem is that Trump has turned into the ""little boy who cried wolf"".  He screamed Fake News at things that were provably true, and he did it over and over.

"I get your point, and I can see why parents want to be able to decide what kind of education their children receive. But if we look at it from a child's rights perspective, don't sexually mature individuals (those capable of sexual reproduction) have a right to biologically accurate information about how their bodies work, along with information about how to avoid unwanted sexual advances? What about families that don't  protect their children, even those families that are loving and well-meaning but oblivious? Don't ""minors"" still have rights that should not be set aside by requiring parental consent? Given the fact that sexual ignorance can be life-threatening and place young people in harm's way, I think we need to entertain the notion that children are human beings with rights of their own, not the property of parents to control as they wish."
The wretched PR firms they hired to attack and stalk people online is atrocious too.

I'd hate to wish ill on anyone - but it's going to be hard to feel sad should your daughter have a pre-mature child; or your wife have a catastrophic accident; or you, the perfect 'Mericun, should develop a cataclysmic disease. 
 It is, frankly, pathetic that you can't see beyond your front porch."
"When Trump boasted about his perverted sexual predations, the right fell all over themselves to excuse it and attempt to normalize it as 'just how the boys do'.
Even the self-proclaimed and self-styled 'righteous' evangelical extremists decided they'd just go ahead and accept Trump and hold him close, never mind their Christian hearts might go all aflutter.
Used to be, for those self same evangelicals, even one divorce would summarily disqualify a candidate, but today, with Trump, they don't care if he runs through wives like some people do the number of new cars they might buy. And the boasting and admitted perverted sexual predation? LIke Trump didn't boast and admit his crime.
Sexual perverts should pay for their crimes. Period. As one, as a society we should condemn them and not allow them to escape punishment.
But, if you're a right winger, you only act like you're outraged if it's not a right winger caught in their perversions.

"If there can be a zillion movements supposedly fighting for black civil rights, then why can there not be a movement for whites or Afrikaners? Why is it then criticized or demonized?

There is everything from Black Lawyers to Black Business to Black Gunowner societies. Yet nothing is ever said about them.

But the (white) liberal media and mostly Media24's Basson and Du Preez constantly attack Afriforum and constantly say they are supposedly fighting for ""white privilege"".

I am so sick of this. Why can white people not have an organization to protect their rights? As a minority these rights are blatantly trampled on by politicians and media on a daily basis.

If it was not for Afriforum, the pandemic of farm murders would not even be in the spotlight. The government ignores it and refuses to act. There are an average of 2 farm murders every single week. Yet the media barely bothers to report on it. It sickens me that those who raise a serious problem are the ones who are demonized."
"That's not a big leap.  I would have assumed that a person who believes they are qualified to determine whose life is more valuable than others, that claims to possess an ""algorithm"" for determining who is ""allowed in my country"", that feels the need to flag others while boasting of their own ""better dead list""...is also well equipped to dealing with being a hypocrite."

"I am not confused about any of the issues you suggested - you are.  

As for the Seder Meal that information is literally from the Book of Exodus and if the Messiah didn't follow those instructions than that would have been proof, in Jesus' time, that he was not the real Messiah.  This is why he did follow these instructions perfectly.

Jesus was a Messiah from Judaism, not the Catholic interpretation of Judaism desperately trying to justify sexism.  Those men and women Israelites who did not eat and take full part of the sacrificial lamb at the first passover (which is what all future passover meals are based on and symbolize), they could not leave Egypt with the rest of the Israelites, per the directions given to Moses by God, to enter the promised land.  This is why every Seder Meal is a Family Meal and why the Last Supper would have been the same way."
Asking and forcing are two different things.
"I read it.   So you're saying the no US government has ever tried to influence and election or 'encourage' a change of leadership in a country, just Hillary?

We have a long history of doing exactly that.  For that matter Hillary never said 'rig' as the title suggest.   She said  ""I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake, said Sen. Clinton. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.

Kinda like asking Russia to release leaks about your opponent in a timely manner.  Or finding a lost tape of Billy Bush.  How about taking millions of dollars from Sheldon Addelman or Tom Steyer?    All these things are done trying to 'make sure that we do something to determine who is going to win'

"It says the opposite in the memo firing him. It says he released ""derogatory information"" on Hillary after the FBI had decided it was a ""declined criminal investigation"" in violation of FBI rules. The letter said his speech on the matter to Congress and his release to the press was like a ""closing argument without a trial"". So he was fired because of the way he handled the release of information about Hillary and the derogatory comments he made about her after the FBI had declined criminal action.  You may remember his remarks about negligence and mishandling documents and so on-- these were the things he did wrong. So as some Republicans have said Trump fired Comey for his mistreatment of Hillary and this is like an apology and a peace gesture to her and the Democrats and putting all the email server stuff behind us. I do not believe that Trump ever do that for Hillary. I think  timing and the subpoenas issued by the grand jury today led him to try to influence the investigation."
We laugh because its moronic and hilarious.

"Your comments fail to recognize that the Eucharist was not only the First Sacrament of Forgiveness---but is also the Sacrament of Spiritual Life.

Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day."" [John 6:53-55].


So, Jesus, himself, tells us that receiving the Eucharist is more than a 'spiritual vitamin'.  It is crucial to spiritual life and eternal life."

"Your poll had only 100 respondents.  Furthermore, those respondents were not at all a representative sample of O'ahu's people.  I noticed that there were only half as many ethnic Filipino respondents as ethnic Japanese respondents, despite the fact that the latest Census discovered that there are actually more Filipinos than Japanese.  I suspect that the gross underrepresentation of Filipinos in your poll is due to the fact that a larger portion of ethnic Filipinos are first generation immigrants who are less well assimilated to Hawaii, harder to contact, and might not speak English; by comparison with the ethnic Japanese.  Your poll takers nevertheless have a duty to get a representative sample and to provide Ilocano or Tagalog interpreters."

"A couple things come to mind in reference to the government shortfall. 1. Ex-gov Frank Murkowski pardoned Exxon from paying the ballance on the Exxon Valdez oil spill. We could use that money now in the constitutional budget reserve fund. 2. Gov Walker paying $54 million for TransCanada interest in the natural gas pipeline. Sure could use that money now. 3. All the contractors gov Walker's been hireing left and right at twice the previous rates. Sure could use that money now. 4. Our legislators could have produced a good budget of cutting government costs. Now gov Walker has to borrow money, driving us deeper in dept. he is spending what we dont have and cant pay back. That is why the Alaska lending rating gets worse. It is a means to say ""hey stop borrowing"". This is the kind of crap that ends up in bankruptcy. If democrat Bill Clinton can ballance the federal budget, why cant the glorious GOP dominance do it here? All I hear is a huge flushing sound of money down the toilet."

"The bishops can oppose injustices in society like abortion.  But they say nothing about women being exposed to rape and sexual violence at home, in schools and in places of work.  Women have the right to accuse the bishops of being complicit in the sexual abuse of women.  Nor do the bishops urge male parents of babies/children to pay support for the care of their children.  

If the bishops are going to oppose abortion, they should be just as adamant about men paying a fair share to support the children that women often have to raise on their own."
"Spot on; how anyone could consider this sleazy, real estate swindler to be qualified, even marginally, as the leader of the free world is simply delusional.

You need to understand that the Anglican Church is not that large compared to ours so if our church and Islam and Judaism are still supporting sexism in religion than we have no idea what difference it would make in the world if all these religions just stopped the hate at once.  

We do know thru various charities and health organizations that any attack against sexism in poor countries has an immediate impact against both poverty & violence & often abuse of both children and women in that area.  

How many Anglican women priests and bishops have been recorded as having abused children?  Do you know the stats on this?  I doubt it is very high.

Much of the evil caused by sexism in religion is by teaching women are less worthy to be priest or leaders so therefore they are less sacred people so therefore why does it matter if they are abused.  The Pope knows this yet continues the hate."

It also quotes a blurb for the book by McMaster, in which he writes that ""terrorist organizations use a narrow and irreligious ideology to recruit undereducated and disenfranchised people to their cause.""

Just considering McMaster's resume of two Bronze stars, a Silver Star, his history as an Armor Commander in the Battle of 73 Easting, his PhD where he questioned the military's role in Viet Nam under LBJ and McNamara, and the rest of his military history, Bannon is just a mouthy toad in comparison."

How is the lost of Taxi service to the poor, disabled, and cash customers in a city once the Taxi Industry is reduced to ashes going to help our society?

How comforting it is to ENDLESSLY point fingers at priests or bishops when we have so many things in our lives that we've constructed shabby excuses for.

"Governor Otter's attempt to make a distinction between ""preference"" and ""discrimination"" is nothing but a silly parsing of words by a politician. When preferences become policy, discrimination is the inevitable result.

Besides being unjust, establishing religious preferences for refugees is bad public policy. The fact that no committed terrorist would hesitate for a moment to pledge allegiance to a particular creed for his own insidious purposes aside, the consequence of this sort of thing will be the dumbing-down of religious faith to a set of simple criteria that might fit on an index card.

I don't want any government official -- least of all the Trump administration -- deciding what defines an adherent of any religion, let alone a Christian. Faith is too rich and too personal and, frankly, none of their damned business."

PP does these thru donations and grants from the States and Fed and Charity Foundations.  No Federal money is allow to be spent on abortions.  The people protesting Planned Parenthood know this, but have decided that a zygote is a person.  These same people believe that Corporations are persons too.  Once again, POOR women get help with birth control via Planned Parenthood.  POOR people mostly do not have insurance, and less will have insurance as soon as the GOP gets done gutting ACA.  POOR women cannot afford to go to Dr for prescription birth control, therefore Planned Parenthood is necessary."

"1)""All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not deadly."" (1 John 5:17) is where we get the concept for mortal sin. 

2) Theologians don't get to set the stakes for what sins are mortal. That comes to us from the Scriptures, from the Tradition and teachings of the Church. Certain acts are defined as causing one to not inherit the kingdom of Heaven (idolatry, adultery, murder, etc.) It's not hard to know these are wrong and fully consent to them at all. It's also wrong to purposely keep people invincibly ignorant so they can sin - that sin will accrue to the person failing to teach right from wrong. 

3)Your argument here seems to be, ""two wrongs make a right."" Evil bishops giving rapist priests a pass gives all of us a pass to do whatever we want. I don't think that will fly with God at the final judgement."

"My child is deathly allergic to bees. We have to have multiple Epi-pens.

She was stung multiple times by wasps. She coded in the ambulance and almost died enroute to the ER. She was 10. Eli-pens expire after a year. For any pharmacy company to make life saving medicine and jack the prices up astronomically is horrible. I am all about making a profit and free trade. We aren't talking about luxury items or expensive toys, this product is medically necessary and life saving. We don't have a choice. We have to pay our medical bills. Jacking up the prices like this is morally wrong. Just because it's legal doesn't mean it is right. This is wrong. As a parent how can we live with ourselves if our child has an allergy and dies because we can't afford an Epi-pen? 911 can't get to everyone in time."

Funny how the right wing judges mostly  do their job, occasionally swinging leftward on their opinions.  But the left wing ones never, ever swing the other direction.

Final note:  Look at both opinions on the EO out of Robard and the 9th Circus.  Neither mentions the relevant federal statute.  As such, both opinions are on policy rather than the law and should be held up for ridicule they so richly deserve.  Cheers -"

Blackhawk was hardly a large military failure: we hammered the poop out of the attackers. Yes, Americans died; not uncommon in military operations. I note you keep skipping around every time I blowup your rather ridiculous statements. Are you aware of that? It's like you forget and move on or something.
Obama didn't destabilize anything: the world changes and the assumption the US can control the world is dumb. Invading Iraq? Dumbest.

Right on. It sounds like Trump's advisors are just as ideologically feckless as the neocons. Of course the U.S. appreciates Taiwan's democratic institutions, but Taiwan isn't crucial to U.S. national interests. China's cooperation in managing the North Korean threat IS crucial. In addition, China owns $1.3 trillion of U.S. debt (not to mention, Trump owes millions to the Bank of China). A Trump representative is confirmed to have met with Taoyuan mayor Cheng Wen-tsan in September to explore investment opportunities, yet another conflict of interest once Trump assumes office, and yet another irritant in China-U.S. relations.

But yes, Trump may help reduce the nuclear risks and other war risks that the libbers are trying to exasperate.  Also, it is untrue that Trump has sole authority over nuclear launches.

It requires that drug trials be sequestered so that those who stand to benefit from the sale of a product have no right to determine who will carry out the trials."
"""The revelation that Mr. Dion approved the bulk of this deal runs contrary to the Liberal claim that the Saudi export deal was a fait accompli. Many observers had assumed the Conservatives had granted export permits. It also makes the Trudeau government more squarely responsible for a deal with a country increasingly cast as a pariah when it comes to human rights. The Harper Tories inked the deal in 2014 but approved only the export of technical data about the vehicles to Riyadh.""

When has Canada ever been anything but a follower of global economic swings?

Whatever else the future brings, there is one lock-solid guarantee: the world will have 9 billion people by 2050, and 12 billion by 2100. (short of a catastrophic meteor strike or global war or somesuch).

Those people will want things. They will not be content to do with less, they, like every human generation will want more.

We can pretend that people will want to be shoved into storage crate existences, living like church mice, or otherwise monastically. We can pretend that Canada will evolve into a giant national eco-park.

But the truth is different. And Canada will still be a land of spaces and resources, even by 2100.

What the world will need, we will have. We would be fools not to plan for that. And right now, we are being fools."
"Thanks for the legal opinion.

It's very simple.   You amend the Property Transfer Tax Act so that the PTT applies to an assignment of an agreement of purchase and sale.   You include a provision which provides that an assignment is unenforceable unless the PTT is paid.   You create penalties for failure to pay."
"The ICC is a racist, colonialist EU court that specializes in persecuting Africans, and now for cover, the US and Russia. Now it is even threatening Canadian soldiers. It is a disaster. Canada must stop funding this travesty of justice."
"New info: A U.S. Department of Homeland Security report appears to undermine the Trump administration's rationale for the president's controversial immigration order. While officials had argued that the temporary ban protected against an increased terror risk posed by immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, the memo states that ""country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity.""

It also notes, ""Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in March 2011, the foreign-born primarily US-based individuals who were inspired by a foreign terrorist organization to participate in terrorism-related activity were citizens of 26 different countries...""

Of the 82 U.S.-based people whose deaths have been linked to the pursuit of a terrorism-related activity, the report says ""slightly more than half were native-born United States citizens.""

"I was making a general comment. You don't like Obamacare.  Personally, I think it's less than ideal. What we should have is single-payer, which is cheaper both per-capita and in total and covers everyone. But to conservatives, the profits of the health insurance industry and multi-million dollar golden parachutes that they pay out is far more important than the health and well-being of the American people. I keep saying that the mantra of the American conservative is ""I've got mine, screw you!""."
"Lotterys and sweepstakes prey on the lowest income among us and those with spending issues already.

Maybe the government can do their damn jobs instead of offloading the balancing of the budget to carnival sideshows like attractions.

"The numbers don't really come as a surprise.  I think most of Trump's supporters have a fairly low level of education and aren't masters of critical thought.  This means that as long as the bombast keeps coming they will continue to stand behind him -- at least for the shorter term.

When they realize that draining the swamp, building a wall, resurrecting the rust belt, and amassing a large trade surplus is easier said than done their attention will drift elsewhere.  And Trump himself, as hardheaded as he is, will likely come to realize that bullyboy tactics don't play exceedingly well with respect to diplomacy.

Trump is a so-so businessman with more bluster than brains, and his main motivation is to keep feathering the nests of himself and his cronies.  If intelligent voices prevail I very much doubt he will see more than four years in the Oval Office."
"RA:  Give it up RA you can't have it both ways!  When the FBI gave Clinton a pass you were all FBI rah, rah.  Now that they have found no direct connection between Putin and Trump you can't bad mouth them unless you are willing to admit you are a hypocrite.  So which is it FBI right or hypocrite?"
My opinion?  No.  It's an assertion of a factual nature.  It's either true or false.  I'm surprised anyone would deny this assertion in good faith.  To give sanctuary to those who have broken our immigration law by entering or remaining here illegally is patently to encourage them in remaining illegally.  This is obvious.  On what ground do you deny it?
Just read an article by NS Auditor General Pickup saying that the NS Teacher's Pension will never be 100% funded & they do not have a plan to see that it is fully funded. It is at 78% currently.

"With all the efforts of a few bad apples, we see they want to kill off most all oil workers in Alaska now!.

It is sad that the Alaska oil & gas agencies are being so harsh and the tax laws always changing to take more from the small competitors.  

The state was shamed worldwide by reniging on the tax credits so the Governor could get more oil royalty income. Is this fraudulent inducement? 

Gov. Walker vetoed these earned credits and chose not to pay these smaller oil companies even with $60 billion in the Permanent Fund and the Constitutional Budget reserve.Is Alaska's name MUD all around the world?

Maybe because of a cheap tactic known as bait and switch! Judge Gleason finding oil and gas agency fail to provide due process and now the AOGCC is attacking small oil companies with unreasonable fines!

Alaska is headed for a devastating fall that will make make all other economic depressions look weak, the U.S. can's save Alaska this time since Uncle Ted has gone to political heaven?"

Now I can't speak for this gentleman, but I know for a fact, I can draw my gun from my IWB holster and fire 3 shots (the first being double-action) center mass from a range of 3-9 feet in 1.5 seconds.

Ive always thought about the issue of nuclear war; its a very important element in my thought process. Its the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobodys focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. Its a little like sickness. People dont believe theyre going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is peoples believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.

"Did you know that even though we have spent $$$$$$ to put in bike lanes on South Willamette, cyclists aren't required to use them? If they prefer to ride on the sidewalk, that's legal and condoned, according to Chris Henry:

""In regards to the people riding bicycles on the sidewalk, they are allowed to do so and are not required to use the bike lane. If a person is riding a bicycle in a roadway where a bike lane is present, the law requires that they use the bike lane unless it is obstructed or they are making a turning movement that would require leaving the bike lane. There is no such law requiring a person riding a bicycle on a sidewalk to use the bike lane instead. Not everyone is comfortable riding a bicycle in the street even when space has been provided for them.""

It will take further action to require cyclists to actually use the bike lanes. This involves a  local authority with road jurisdiction and a public hearing according to http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/814.420."

"Turning Medicaid into state block grants would force states to manage/restrict the spending; else it will bankrupt the country as another open-ended entitlement. Why do you think Colorado can't fund roads and schools? That's just the result of the state portion of Medicaid, and let's see 1 in 4 are on food stamps. Then we also feed the kids in school, sort of a double-entitlement. States are the only ones to try to innovate and streamline due to balanced budget requirements. Dems, this is your cue to howl, and denigrate and call names!"
"Obama  has  proven  numerous  times  he  loves  traitors  and  criminals,  being  one  himself."
"No, it's the will of people in some urban areas that she be the President of the United States. Thank God our Founders understood that Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for dinner and chose not to go that way."
"Now, gradually lower the income cut off at which OAS starts to be clawed back to somewhere around the average annual wage, or YMPE, or lower, instead of $70K. Workers making less than that should not be taxed to support retirees who already have more than the average worker. It won't save as much money, but it will be far fairer, and allow those who can't work to retire at 65 with dignity."
Well there is opposition for it to go west and east and north is not an option.

"Darn! Canadians are inundated with bad government, making bad decisions."
"Yes, God forbid we allow the central government to use healthcare as a means for social engineering the general public. Hell they might even be able to get rid of the 2nd amendment if they can determine it to be health issue.

"And it is not just a meaningful conversation they claim they want, it's one that is respectful and caring. But as usual, it only involves things liberals respect and care about and as always it focuses on what they hate. Here is a typical liberal conversation about respect and care. ""Thos Godd*** bigoted, masoginist, homophobic Republicans shoud all just DIE!!!!! Then we would have a nice world to live in. Have a nice day.""

Now honestly we can not blame them for this because to have a real conversation about respect and caring they would actually have to show respect and caring, and that is simply not in their DNA."
"When it comes to corruption, political favors, incompetence and job-killing, Canada is certainly back.   In other words, the Liberals are certainly back!"
"So for Gingrich, it's about going full-boat cray by embracing a narcissistic know-nothing buffoon who happens to be their meal ticket to power, disregarding his erratic and dangerous behavior -- all because if they don't, those Democrats might win.

"""If any US President can simply be blocked by the deep state, then the US is not free at all... There is an illusion of choice when in reality there is none.""

There's way too much truth to what you say for my liking. The same is true of Canada and any other purported democracy.

The advantage of elected political leaders (whatever their stripe and however thin their majority) is that they're public entities. They rise and fall on what they say and reveal to the electorate. The deep state isn't like that. It thinks it knows better than the electorate, especially where its own interests are concerned. The deep state is a shadow state. Shine a light on it and it disappears.  

Deep states don't exist in dictatorships because all state functions are rigidly combined. The more democratic a state, the more influence its shadow state will wield. And the more affluent that democratic state is, the greater that influence will be."
"The Democratic Party both nationally and here has lost its soul. It has become an exclusive private club where the insiders ""wash each others backs,"" enriching the few at the expense of the many..

"The nastiness led by the media  by its twistandturn  attempts at journalism  against Pres. Donald Trump is appalling.  They have been at him in a most  obnoxious micro managing  dog on bone way led by CNN .  There is so much innuendo , undertones and fabricated allusions directed against the whitehouse by hillbilly CNN pundits since Pres. Donald Trump ran for office  that  we who are sane and see between the zealot pursuit by democrats and their supporeters,  ask WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE?."
"The right to contraception coverage, albeit with a copay, was established by the EEOC in December 2009.  It is going nowhere and will still cover religious groups (all that changed was taking away the copay).  Getting rid of the mandate is not worth throwing immigrants under the bus.  The USCCB staff is playing coalition politics again.  Eventually, Cupich will be USCCB chair and heads should roll."

"Sorry, but anyone who believes that Saudi Arabia's ultra-reactionary philosophy of bigotry and hatred of other religions ( including other sects of Islam )  is anything new is either blatantly lying, or is insane.

So OK, if he is not lying, then I guess that we can say that the poor man is delusional, and is mentally ill.

I've posted clear facts showing that other members of the press ( and even his own newspaper, the New York Times ), have known about this for a very long time.    This is not a new development.  Not by any means.   To state otherwise, as he has done here in this editorial, is to spread FALSEHOODS.

"Hayley W has, indeed,  had a long and productive career although I think in the grand scheme of things it is overrated.  Yes, she has excelled and persisted in a league/game diluted in talent. and still , by any objective analysis, in the ""developmental stage"" (no team other than Canada or the USA has won a world championship OR Olympic Gold -ever). That is not her fault and someone has to start women's hockey, but to imply she is one the greatest female athletes who pushed the limits of what a women can do is hyperbole. I guess folks have never heard of Billy Jean King or Marilyn Bell (the first PERSON to swim across Lake Ontario). Ference is clearly speaking from a personal perspective which is fine, but it is not objective."
"Yeah. What a jerk. The most powerful person in the world takes the time out of his busy schedule to thank regular people like bell persons and front desk clerks.

"The most sad thing about this is that those poor former miners actually believe that any of them will go back to work in the mines.  They won't.  Trump has been lying to them about bringing back coal jobs like he lies about everything else.

Trump is a psychotic."
"That need for ""rebranding"" just got harder.  Cardinal DiNardo ""called on President Donald Trump to ease the 'onerous' contraceptive mandate of the Department of Health and Human Services under the Affordable Care Act because it violates religious freedom.""  DiNardo has an op-ed piece in The Hill.  

Just great.  Trump and the Republicans will use that to sell the idea that the ACA has to go and that those who voted against the Republican Senate re-write were opposing religious freedom.  

Couldn't DiNardo just have kept his trap shut?  Is he so stupid that he doesn't get it that he is playing into the hands of those who will end public support for assuring access to health care?

"You are NOT paying for my insurance. I don't buy on exchange because I earn too much to qualify for tax credit. I have purchased my own policy since 98 when I became self employed; in MN, ID, and then 06 in WA before/after ACA which does not ""rake off 20% of insurers take."" So I remember the FACTS. 

I prefer Canada single payer as silly lib me thinks everyone should have coverage; either way I pay (taxes or uninsured ER use resulting in higher premiums). My premiums went up every year because I was a year OLDER and care/drug cost increases far outpaced inflation. Went up > 600% 98 to 10; 250% 11-17.

I remember lifetime caps as low as $75,000 (friend got cancer/filed bankruptcy); up to 9 prices for each age year due to pre-existing conditions; flat out denied coverage for certain pre-existing; and when insurers had no minimum premium threshold to spend on insured pool so wasted half or more on retreats, absurd salaries etc. ACA implemented thresholds, accountability, and oversite."

"I am sick to my stomach to read the lies written in this story concerning the so called ""White supremacy"" causing the violence in SC.  White facists  did show up and were violent!  Equally violent were the antifa.  The Unite the Right people applied for and received a permit to protest the removal of the monuments, most in this group did not come to be violent.  When the antifa showed up armed to the teeth looking for a fight, the police declared the entire event illegal.  Police  circled the Unite the Right group on three sides (other extremist groups were also arriving), police threatened Unite the  Right with arrest if they did not leave, forcing the group through the armed antifa. That is when the violence began. Police  did nothing to prevent or intervene in the violence.  The violence at this event is horrifying, and just as horrifying are the outrageous lies this reporter ""reports"" as truth.  LA Times and Buzzfeed were reference as sources, apparently fake news begets fake news"

"So again no facts. Just a statement with no facts to back it up.

I like the Democrats on the end there. Apparently those that defend the south and can remember the civil war do not remember the Democratic purge of racists from the ranks in the late 60s and the use of Nixon and the Republicans and the Southern Strategy to pull those racists into the Republican side. Or maybe you missed the President of the USA excusing racist behavior because apparently, much to my surprise, he thinks that some nazis are very nice people.

Even Robert E Lee and Jefferson Davis didn't want statues and felt that the south should just get over it and store that crap in a museum. The Jim Crow just keeps on cawing, showing you folks for your true colors."
"It does not block any group or any subgroup, Dunleavy said. What it basically says is the teaching of sex ed will be done by a teacher with a Type-A certificate.

Is Boss Dunleavy going to require that all subjects be taught by someone with a Type A teaching certificate? So that no group can present information on any subject unless they are a certificated teacher? 

If not, there goes the First Amendment once again, as he is clearly trying to restrict the speech of one group with whom he disagrees.

A two-year residence may help to discourage these free-loaders from moving on to Hawaii.  We have enough of our own families to care for, than taking on the freeloaders who have not contributed to maintain this service for people in need, and vacation in Hawaii at our expense.   And by the way, are there children with these nomads?  A hand up is OK, but this is just free money...stupid!"
"Kevin Brew, I suppose you are right but the screening out process isn't just at the hiring phase, right? Each new hire have to go through the Academy and through a FTO program so there is a redundant system. Or there is suppose to be one.

I do remembered once, we had an officer under the FTO program and during an institutional count, he was cooking ramen for the inmates.........and you know that such behavior is preclude of someone who can be twisted like Spindler. But you can't fire him!! He left on his own which paid off on both sides but I think not understanding the moral strength of any employee in such a job, is an oversight that belied any background check or interview tricks. This isn't a new thing, stuff like this was going on when I was working for Division of Corrections.....as well as Department of Corrections!!! It only take one, to blacken the effort of all."

And at that point, Yahoo mail becomes nothing more than a spam filter (tech recycling at its finest)...then, who cares what gets scanned - and by whom - because it's all junk..."

"Clearly the Globe is exaggerating.  The federal government is fully in command of the process.  It didn't use the Syrian refugee crisis during the last election to trash and refocus a prudent, popular refugee approach for a few votes and photo opts.   The federal government didn't dump these people in Canada without a plan to integrate them asap into the country's fabric.  It's fully aware of the tragedy of some European communities where large pools of unintegrated, alienated individuals have been allowed to develop. While programs to address the situation may be long-term and expensive, this is what the federal government, that is what we, opted for. We cannot afford to repeat the failures of elsewhere.  So let's hear the plan and get moving on it."

Don't forget what Justin said during his Tim Hortons apology tour - 'the oil sands will be phased out'."
"All I know is that my health insurance cost increased over 300% in 2017 and my co payments increased as well.  Now when I need medical care I go to a private provider and do not use my insurance because it's more expensive.  For example recently I went to Kaiser for a skin cancer screening, not only did I get billed a $150 as a co - payment, I was not seen by a dermatologist or even a doctor!  Health care in the United States is very broken and way to expensive."
"This rubbish is getting so tiresome, the constant smarmy rationalizations by a constituency of people with an oversupply of ego and an undersupply  of the intellectual wattage required to have made a choice that should have been obvious to a child. If Clinton had been elected, talented and capable people would have flocked to serve in the administration, we would have a fully staffed and functional executive branch, including Departments of State and Justice and robust Intelligence Services, we would have a chief executive welcomed warmly abroad instead of being greeted by massive protests. Instead, we have a sad collection of saboteurs, shills for wealthy interests, amateurs, bumblers, crooks and possible foreign agents, and another right-wing ideologue on the Supreme Court. 

So spare us the nauseating self-congratulation and enjoy your helping of Trump."

See the problem with protesting against the National Anthem...your message cannot be focused.  Sure, go ahead, you have the right to protest, but it's the wrong way to protest if you are serious about your protest.  Seriously, how many are actually kneeling for freedom of speech?  I don't believe this for a nano-second.  They are kneeling to show their anger to Trump which is an entirely different message.  I want players to wear signs so we know what each player is kneeling about.  Totally unfocused method of protestation.  Keep the National Anthem out of it if you want a focused protest."

Being costly does not mean its overly broad. As someone on the ground I can and will tell you that SB91 is a disaster.

He is just unpredictable.

Demonization by some makes them feel better but that is about all it gains them. 

I disagree with some of what he has done and appears to be trying to do. 

Some of it makes sense, like requiring NATO to meet their treaty obligations regarding 2% of their GDP and troops rather than having the US bear the brunt of NATO.

Discouraging illegal immigration in favor of legal immigration makes sense to me.  The people doing it legally should get preference over those who don't.  

Trying to stop the revolving door of criminals who commit crimes here and then get deported and then come right back to commit more crimes makes sense to me. 

Reducing the bribes by the State Department to places like Afghanistan makes sense to me."

"The comparison to the premier of the province while popular is not a logical one.  The premier, Prime Minister and the President of the United States are all vastly underpaid for the actual job they do. That said all of them are still in the top 5% of wage earners so they are not hard done by. However, they are politicians and accept the realities of the restraints on their salary.  

There are not that many people on the sunshine list who make more than the Premier and the list shrinks even more when you take off the doctors who are specialists. You might find about 100 people who would be left on the list out of a list of over 100,000 employees when you include all the people who work in hospitals, schools, municipalities and universities and colleges."

In the past 30 years, Wahhabism came out from the Arabian peninsula and started taking over the moderate Sunnis of the middle east that were mostly Hanafi and Shafii. Zaher's whole Sunni generation is poisoned by Wahhabism. 

Zaher's article is not based on ay fact, but rather spreading biased and unsubstantiated propaganda that serves only Sunni extremism. Whether he is aware of it and doing it purposely is something he can only tell. But his article and views serve only one purpose: the division of the middle east into religious states that serve primarily existing religious fanatics, namely in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. These states would like nothing better than seing the area divided into religious countries that allows them to extend their influence, and they hope to resolve the Palestinian problem along the same lines, by watering it down with religion, since most Palestinians are Sunnis"

"So no O-line, no running game, no TE (or slot receiver) and DT playing hampered and you expect a 1st year starter to carry the load (not even Brady was able to do that).

Add to that his injury and a scheme that is antiquated and took too long for plays to develop (btw, Siemian had the 8th highest 4th Quarter QB rating - which shouldn't be surprising as that's when Trevor was no longer ""shackled"" by the scripted plays).

How did Dak do last weekend when he no longer had a run game to rely on; and the Cowbys have a way better pass protecting O-line than what Trevor had last year.

Schofield - gone.
Sambrailo - gone.
Stephenson - basically a back-up to the back-up at the tackle positions.
Garcia - wouldn't be the starter if there was a better option.

The Broncos are 8-1 when Siemian attemps 35 or fewer passes (with the one loss being to KC, a game they should have won) and 7-1 when CJ plays (the one loss there being the Chargers game when Trevor came back too early from his injury)."

Inform the office that you have a conceal carry license and you are now carrying. never say ""I HAVE A GUN!""3. Ask the officer how would he/she like to proceed. Never ever reach for anything. Not your wallet. Not your registration. Not your conceal carry permit. In most cases the officer will ask where your weapon is located and ask you to leave it there or have you exit the vehicle and secure the weapon themselves for the duration of the traffic stop.

"Nice article. Gotta correct you on the pahoehoe vs a'a density. You are mostly correct. A'a  has a much higher viscosity than pahoehoe, due in part to it having a lower gas content. When it is flowing, it behaves like a very dry bread dough with shaggy floury lumps (the clinkers you referred to) solidifying and falling off the top or being pushed along the front of the flow. The resulting rock has fewer and smaller trapped air spaces when it cools, and is in fact very dense.  If you're lucky enough to be in the right spot at the right time you can observe a pahoehoe flow become an a'a flow as it loses gas (or changes slope and velocity). Of course the Hawaiians were smart enough to wait until the lava cools before classifying it one way or the other. While it is warm and orange, it is just Pele."

Unemployment rates were sub 5% when he took office and wages were already rising. He ostensibly got on  horse that was going in the right direction. He has no answer for the fact that for every one job lost to offshore labour, eight jobs are lost to technology and automation. the thermal coal industry was replaced by natural gas. Unless one is mining metallurgical coal, you old job isn't coming back.

Permanent deacons have no authority, vote, voice or purpose beyond that of the laity in our church.  

The laity need to stand up against this evil attitude of exclusion & treating everything that the world has stereotyped female as less sacred, less intelligent, less deserving of same civil and sacred rights and sacraments now & with ferocity.  This homily reveals a pope who has a real hatred of women as human beings.  We are not a stereotype-we are human beings and are equally man to men.

Work with Women's Ordination Conference to fight this gender segregation!  We must stand against married priests until women are ordained equally priests as a matter of human dignity.  We must also rebuke any ban on gay priests!"

"JJ, There has not been scientific evidence of chemical trespass or any health effects at this time from aerial application of herbicides in forest practices. There have been a couple of direct exposure incidents where the applicator has been found negligent and subsequently fined and punished. Advanced drop size technology eliminates drift and current regulations only allow two applications of herbicides on commercial timber during the growth cycle of 40 to 60 years. Aerial spray is not a major health threat. Although, study after study has proven that poverty is a major health threat. I am dedicated to improving our economy to decrease the amount and severity of poverty, that will have the greatest long term health benefits. The timber industry employs folks at family wages and supports services through charity and taxes to our vulnerable populations."
"Hundreds of millions of federal dollars will be cut to numerous health organizations in Alaska. As a result many layoffs in the health care sector will occur. This will deepen the recession. Also, insurance premiums will rise dramatically for similar coverage as Wall Street insurance companies are liberated to charge whatever the maximizes their return. So, economically, it is a big hit on our tiny rural population aside from the loss of health coverage. And we are all just a car accident, gunshot or bear attack away from needing healthcare."

In 1994, Crimea's independence and pro-Russia movement was growing, and Crimea formed a separatist government.
the UN polled Crimea quarterly from 2009 - 2011, and each time found that a majority of Crimean residents wanted to rejoin Russia.
In 2014, around the time of the Maiden coup in Kiev, and pre-referendum in Crimea, various international pollsters found that nearly 80% of polled Crimean residents wanted to rejoin Russia.
Post Crimean referendum, many international pollsters investigated the satisfaction of Crimeans with the referendum outcome, and typically found that over 85% of Crimeans were fully satisfied with the referendum outcome, while further Crimeans were mostly or generally satisfied with the referendum outcome.
The polling of Crimea is consistent and clear."

The document also notes that during a Missouri House Judiciary Committee meeting convened to discuss Democrat Representative Don Wells anti-Sharia law bill, he said he believed Sharia law is like polio.

Since few growers are signing up for the legal marijuana program  there is actually a concern whether enough will sign up and submit to regulation so the legal market can be supplied.  This is a time of great glory and opportunity for the black market.  The best thing that could happen now would be Federal de-regulation and let the states decide one at a time what their policy is going to be.  Eventually all state governments will want a piece of the action and will do something to generate tax revenue.  It would be stupid not to.

This was an appeal to the grant of a TRO not invalidating anything.  That comes on a trial on the merits.  In this case it'll be during the trial for a permanent injunction not the temporary restraining order."
Where they meet is irrelevant.  What they accomplish will be the measure of merit.

"More than an indirect role.  Moderates were in charge of the Japanese government until mid 1940.  The U.S. terminated America's long-standing commercial treaty with her. After January 1940 Japan had to ask permission on a case-by-case basis whenever she wanted to import from the United States. In July 1940 the administration had further prohibited exports to Japan by requiring her to get a license to purchase aircraft engines and strategic materials. (When sale of aviation gas, defined by the United States as 86 octane or higher, was embargoed on July 1, 1940, she had contrived a way to use 76 octane in her planes.1) The administration was tightening an economic noose around Japan's neck bit by bit, forcing her to look elsewhere for the supplies and materials she had been accustomed to buying from the United States."

"@hapaguy's point is that the Republicans are being hypocrites by complaining about Obama EO's, yet not complaining about Trump's EO's when he's signed nearly twice as many. It's a double standard, and hypocrisy.

"It seems to me all these Titans are thinking inside the box. Try thinking about decreasing corporate taxes to zero, perhaps incrementally over a number of years, and proportionally eliminating capital gains exemptions and special treatment for dividends. All types of personal income taxed identically, but zero corporate taxes. I am sure there are precautions that must be taken to avoid abuses, but this is the way it should be done. Innovation will continue, loopholes for the wealthy are closed. Taxing corporations was always just a political way of disguising personal taxes that ended up giving the wealthy and high income a bunch of ways to avoid taxes that are not available to people earning salaries and wages. It is an embedded part of the misleading rhetoric of all parties, particularly the NDP where they make corporate taxes sounds like an equalizer when they are largely the opposite."
"The comments about Muslims being rejected for their clothing and skin color really are a play to the lowest common denominator of society.

They are now quickly becoming unwelcome as the public wakes up the fact they are living through another social engineering experiment courtest of the left. Again."

Has anyone asked what this governments goals are what will of this accomplish usually when you spend 100's of billions of dollars on this theory of manmade climate change you would say if you spend this you will achieve this.

They won't answer this question because it won't reduce the temp .001 of a degree it will not change climate.  It will accomplish nothing.

"Horgan's comments on the notwithstanding clause put me in mind of the comments on stupid people by the late great philosopher George Carlin:

""Did you ever notice that? How many really stupid people you run into during the day?
Goddam there's a lot of stupid b******s walking around.
Carry a little pad and pencil with you. You'll wind up with thirty or forty names by the end of the day.
Look at it this way: Think of how stupid the average person is and then realize that half of them are stupider than that.
And it doesn't take you very long to spot one of them does it? Take you about eight seconds.
You'll be listening to some guy...you say...""this guy is f****** stupid!""

Horgan clearly  falls into Carlin's Dan Quayle category - stupid, full of s**t and f*****g nuts.

We are speaking of a different thing, incompetence, corruption, fraud, deceit. Obviously neither you nor many of Trump's voter cared that Trump was and is a womanizing playboy with no perceptible morals. The fact that someone else was, also, is no excuse whatsoever.

"Maybe it's not so much that Trump evangelicals reject Christ as they really know very little about the historical Jesus, his example, or what he stood for. It could be a situation where the Trump evangelicals, habituated to being overindulged by the Republican party, would embrace any candidate, however perverted and degenerate, that massaged them just right. 
I enjoy imagining evangelicals on election day, casting their vote for the candidate that appeared on a Playboy magazine cover with a scantily clad Playboy bunny, her hand reaching down through the back of her dress and peeking out of the bottom of her dress only inches from Trump's genital area. It gives me satisfaction knowing that there is no limit beyond which evangelicals will not debase themselves in their quest for worldly power."

"No, although here in BC Company Drug Plans would like that to happen. I have to register for BC Government Fair Pharmacare (Income Based), even when the odds of me ever reaching my annual family deductible were slim to none, at least until I started needing Cinacalcet / Sensipar. When you pay your bill there are 3 categories in the fee. 

1. what you pay at the counter
2. the portion paid by your Employment Drug Plan
3. the portion paid by the BC Government Plan once you reach your annual family deductible

"""The thing is, I cant help feeling an internal conflict about how warm it is, and how strange that the plants are budding about a month earlier than normal.""

They are not budding about a month earlier than normal.  They are budding mid- to late-April, like they do every year.  We are even still waiting for the ice to break on the Nenana River.  For the record, the earliest break up of the Nenana River was today, April 23, 1993 1:01 PM AST.

"Rather than diversify exports, Canada will need to get used to shorter production runs of items like cars just for our own market.  They would be built in flexible production plants that make several models rather than just one.  That was believed to be impractical in the 1950's before the Auto Pact ( forerunner to FTA and NAFTA), but should be possible today with all the robotic and computer aids. Building the tooling is faster and cheaper than ever. It's a new, deglobalizing world, with in country only supply chains and Canada can adapt just fine. Results will be more fairly distributed due to labour shortages than they ever were under open trade. Globalization was a theory that never produced results for most people here or in the USA. Glad to see it go."

"""Wiretap"" is not a colloquial term for the generality of covert surveillance. It is being spun as such by a coterie of the lie who seek to reconstruct a world in the image they wish to make us believe. Wiretap is a specific methodology of the general process of surveillance. 
Can anyone (other than, maybe in-utilitias, imagine someone reporting to the police on being followed by a suspicious person: 
""Sargeant I am being wire-tapped""
""Excuse me?""
""I'm being wire-tapped by some scary person""
""Okay, we'll send a technician over to check your phone""
""No, I mean I'm being watched""
""You mean then that there's a hidden camera observing you?""
""Nooooo.....I'm being wire-tapped...""
This is not  even ""alternative truth"" it is ""nutty"", ""lie"", and presumes that every-one else is stupid.

I think your reasoning powers took a hike, Groucho. Any rational human being can readily see and understand that what we believe defines who we are. And if you think attacking the RCC is not an attack on every member who advocates their church theology, then I guess you think any attack on the USA is not an attack on you.

Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Thursday that the most important thing he could do during his tenure was to make the State Department more efficient, and in a lengthy letter to employees he promised that the efforts would yield significant savings.

You cannot honestly claim that house prices within 1 mile of a well or even 1000 feet of a well are suffering losses to value when the average home price in the county goes up almost 50,000 in one year and the biggest increases happened within 1 mile of oil and gas activity."

"Their system was good at the start - collectors provide loyalty and access to AirMiles for much valuable information to sell - and AirMiles returned the loyalty with Miles that are banked and could be spent. However that is not really how it works anymore, and the ROI for collectors has been cut substantially, to the extent at which it can actually cost more to be involved then not often. I simply loved the program in the past and was its biggest supporter and vocal about it. However it is now junk, and becoming junkier by the second. I have been trying for weeks to get a trip somewhere wam, and have tried dozens of places with a myriad of dates - there is nothing! Today I went to Sobelys - and was told by the mgr that I could not purchase with AirMiles as AirMiles purchase system had been taken down, for how long he could not say. Nobody was informed of this as far as I can find......  I had to go home with nothing, wasting my time for the trip, and Sobeys had to put all back in stock"

Absolutely agree.  This article is a pile of baloney puffing up a routine meet and greet between Trump and the Chinese leader. World War III was not averted here.  I hope that the Globe doesn't publish any more articles from the fool who wrote this one.

"In addition, Colorado and the City and County of Denver don't have a residential longevity requirement for several human services. Colorado as a whole is made up of 60% non-natives and 40% natives. In the Denver metro area, it is 76% non-natives and 24% native (go to the Colorado demographer's web page for these numbers). So in effect our policies have been subsidizing other states' citizens for YEARS. So if you are from CA, FL, TX, etc. and your are below the income threshold, you're good! But if you are a struggling native and you're slightly above the threshold, you're hosed! The whole system is screwed up that it stacks against the long time taxpaying native. There should be a long-term residential requirement for these programs."

Province's dependant on fossil fuel for electricity, try an new approach. Instead of selling excess across the international border try an inter provincial grid. After all the first priority should be supplying Canada first. Politicians and business look at existing opportunities across the border rather than creating opportunities in Canada. I know initially it is cheaper but in the long run it should have it's benefits. Canada is much bigger than a 500 mile corridor along the U.S. border."

Changing rules because someone died doing something incredibly stupid is not an answer. Our Mayor is so fond of blitzes. Well, Mr. Mayor, put some traffic cops on the intersections and start enforcing the law. That means tickets for pedestrians, bicycles and cars. Equally. Cars are an easy marks and a lot more lucrative for fines, I get that, but until everyone buys into traffic safety, we will see this tragedies repeat themselves with a grim regularity."

If you are working to be sustainable, reducing costs, taking materials out of the waste stream, and dealing with the many impacts on the environment while making plywood or paper or lumber, using wood waste for power makes some sense. Of course there are real issues too! Fly ash is a real issue for those like me that have become aware of the long-term health implication of fine particles.

Don't get me wrong, the DPRK is a growing and serious threat and there may not be a way out of a conflict at this point.  They have been seriously mishandled and underestimated by every president (both GOP and Dems) since the Korean war."

If interest rates rise, and they invariably will, it will take Ontario much, much longer to pay back its debt.

I once asked my brother in law why he kept electing the liberals even though they had multiple scandals, were corrupt and had racked up the debt beyond belief. 

His response: ""Oh, I'm not worried about the debt. The rest of Canada will help pay it and I dont really know about the other stuff!!"" 

I nearly choked from disbelief. So I asked him one simple question

If the rest of Canada is on the hook for Ontarios debt, dont you think Ontario would then be on the hook for every other provinces debts?

He didnt like that response

But you get the idea ... a province of fools..."
"Keep in mind that Sweden (and Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland) has a lower corporate tax rate than Canada does.

Germany has a slightly higher corporate tax rate (~29% vs. ~26.5% in Canada) but provides substantial tax advantages for small and medium businesses.

European countries, in general, have very high VAT rates but their income taxes, particularly at the high-end, are usually comparable or lower than those in Canada, so a business owner in one of these ""high tax"" countries might actually be better off, tax-wise, than they would be in Canada."

I believe we can, and should, take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions...I think it's worth our time to broaden the conversation and re-examine some proposals that are habitually left out. I believe it's important to act quickly on climate change - but it's more important to find the right policy. Business Roundtable, December, 2009

Lisa also walks the talk on clean energy, taking the lead to write a bipartisan energy bill that would provide $500 million to research and develop clean energy and bringing  Energy Secretary Moniz and a bunch of Senators to Bethel and Oscarville to see innovative, clean energy solutions and energy efficient housing. 

But Margaret Stock would rather fool you than tell the truth."

"It seems like a racist reaction, thick80.  But it's not.  Really, it's not.  

What your reading, hearing, seeing, is frustration and anger at a Prime Minister who, in this instance, is no better than Tweeter-in-Chief, Donald Trump.  The PM popped off a fast tweet thinking, ""What a good boy am I...so welcoming.""  And created much more than a hurry-up-with-the tents knee-jerk in response to the foreseeable increase in border-jumping Haitians. He created a HUGE unnecessary expense for the government (and, therefore, the tax-payers) of this country, when a majority of these people will likely be refused (with good reason) and sent--not back to the USA, but to Haiti!  And we pay the shot!

Which poses the question: whose dumber, here: the freaked-out Haitians or the ""ain't I grand"" PM?

Nothing racist about that!"

"I don't think so.   Are you sure you're not being overly simplistic?  

The accusation is that Trump cooperated with Russia to affect the American election.

There is no evidence that Clinton did the same.   As you pointed out Clinton had a pretty hostile relationship with Putin - and for myself I'm glad that she did.    (I think he's an ass, an authoritarian, and has used his power for personal wealth and used the wealth to consolidate his power.  

If you want to talk corruption by the Clinton foundation and it's influence on a sitting secretary of state, go right ahead.    

You can't use Clinton misdeeds to wash away Trump forever.  BOTH however can stand on their own and face the consequences."

Take comfort in the fact that while you say you've studied ""this stuff,"" there's a whole lot of other relevant stuff that you haven't studied-and have no interest in learning--and thus you will remain an enduringly ignorant and patently insecure person with a huge chip on your shoulder.

Whether or not people choose to say 'Merry Christmas' is not something for the government of the United States to concern itself with, let alone for the president to make a cause. But he's doing what he always does, which is throw raw meat to his base. Trump may be a buffoon, but he knows what gets the troops fired up.

"anyone who trusts these guys to effectively manage a new infrastructure bank need only look at Ontario where they simply did whatever the heck they wanted to, with other peoples money.  When things didn't work out right, they simply poured more money into it.  That is exactly what will happen with this.  Government cannot stimulate an economy effectively with more money. They simply choose winners, and therefore losers. The winners have the lobbyists and the money to get to ""have dinner"" with the ministers.  The losers, well, they don't matter. At the end of the day, the money will be gone, and my generation, my kids generation, and their kids generation will be stuck with the bills.  funny, on one hand the government is requiring money to save the planet, for the sake of the future generations, all the while knowing the carbon plan won't make any difference at all in the world, and on the other hand is willing to shackle our citizens with debts they cannot every pay. Pathetic."

"As someone who as lived with this allergy since the age of 3 - and one that also includes sesame seeds and all fish and seafood - i find the amount of money and time spent on trying to help kids eat peanuts and peanut butter safely nothing short of ridiculous.  I have flown all over the world,  travelled many places and went to many summer camps - long before peanut butter was banned in lunch rooms, planes and classrooms and before epipens were available. I have had one incident in my 55 years.  The allergies mean I have to be careful and i live with an epipen and benadryl. What my parents taught me was to advocate for myself, be careful and always ask about the ingredients. I travel with cards in the foreign languages outlining my allergies and yes, sometimes I just don't eat. With all due respect, I think the time and money spent on this research could be better allocated elsewhere. It's just an element of a food group. And not an essential one."

"Actually, EV makers are targeting developing countries as it is far easier to set up a network of EV chargers than a gasoline distribution network. Check out Central America where reusable electricity is becoming the norm and with it you will see a huge market for loewr-end (price-wise) EVs. China is developing small and cheap EVs - they are the ones in great shape to capture this market.

Saudi Arabians orchestrated and attacked the U.S. homeland.  Saudi Arabia Monarchy rules under Sharia law of torture and terror.  Qatar is a Constitutional Monarchy, one of the few in the entire area.  Trump's words and actions are violations of diplomacy and traitorous to real U.S. interests throughout the world.

In response to the ordination of women in the Episcopal Church (the second one being in 1974) the CDF declared that women CANNOT be ordained to the priesthood in 1976.  The CDF invoked Vatican II (Lumen gentium 25) regarding the infallible teaching capacity of all bishops when in communion with one another, and that it has always been the ordinary, constant and definitive teaching of all bishops throughout the world.  As a result, JP2's letter on the matter ""handed on"" this same teaching by his formal declaration, thereby making explicit what is always and everywhere to be held by all as belonging to the deposit of faith. 

So where was Pope Francis to go?  There was nothing else he could do, period.  And there is right now no possible way for a change in that infallible teaching to be made.  However, it should be noted that the CDF's declaration is itself non-infallible!  So the debate continues, as it should.  The theologians have the matter now."

Everyman's journey, sometimes embarrassing, often ackward, but always a good laugh. Stuart McLean made me proud to be Canadian and thankful for all the great things I love about this country.

The last time I used a cab, the cab drivers conversation was extremely inappropriate (racist).  They think because they are on the road all the time they can drive however they want. One last note: I happen to live by a Shell station and over time noticed several cab drivers using the window washer/squeegee to wash the ENTIRE car, which ruins the squeegee (dirt and grime that can scratch the windows of the next person to use it. thanks guys).

"Trump said on the campaign back in December 2015:
It was reported today [Obama] played 250 rounds of golf and hes going to be in Hawaii, I think did they say for three weeks? Trump said at a Monday night campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich. (via Golf.com). Two hundred and fifty rounds, thats more than a guy who plays in the PGA Tour plays. He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We dont have time for this. We have to work. Obama golfed 333 times as president, according to Mark Knoller of CBS News, a noted scrutinizer of presidential schedules. Obama golfed at a rate of once for every 8.8 days he was in office.
April 1st was the 72nd day of Trumps presidency. The Palm Beach Posts best estimate is that Trump has played golf 12 times through Saturday. Including his round with Rand Paul, thats a rate of once every 5.9 days.  Golfer in Chief  hard at work.  Hypocrite!!!  But what else do you expect from such a liar. ""We have work to do."""
I wasn't justifying anything. I was merely saying this story doesn't have all the facts. Don't have to get so defensive lol. Calm down.
"""The president's reluctance to condemn white bigots also stood in stark contrast by his insistence of calling out ""radical Islamic terrorism"" by name.""
So frigging disappointing but not at all surprising, that that weasel and lowest common denominator Trump, has yet again refused to acknowledge and condemn this violent ruddy act of ""radical White Nationalist terrorism"" in Virginia!!!  Isn't this the same campaign candidate Trump, who could not or would not or flatly refused the political support/endorsement of the KKK too???  Bottom line: because Trump and his Administration have positioned themselves as the true and real representatives and supporters of white nationalists, that in turn, make up a large part of Trump's political support base, NO way will anyone ever hear that weak sleazebag Trump ever risk further offending his support base by ever calling them out for anything."

It stops with people who took up arms against the U.S. and its constitution, to defend slavery. Stop pretending you don't understand the difference.

"In the article, the teacher retired in 2006. So they never had the opportunity to earn the average salary for 2015. Also - many teachers are hired at very low starting salaries and never get paid the average. ""Average salary"" essentially means that half of all teachers make less, and the other half make more.

I am a teacher, and I never expect to get rich. But with a masters degree, professional teaching license, multiple career technical education credentials, and a national board certification, I feel I should at least be able to earn a good salary. (According to payscale dot com, the average salary in Denver is currently $60,805. That is for all workers, including those without college degrees.)

Contrary to popular opinion, teachers are not greedy. We only want to earn pay that is similar to other well-educated, seasoned professionals. (And most of us are very willing to work year-round, too.)"

1. CBO predicted that with ACA the # of uninsured would drop to 30 million by 2016, almost exactly right.
2. If you compare the prognostications about the economic impacts from all major think tanks and all Republicans ever who (were screaming about the inevitable 'death panels'), CBO comes out the best.

Facts are stubborn things.
Is winning so important to you that you'll lie about the CBO rather than realize that your own policy beliefs might be wrong in this one case?"

"From my experience, the expat story is really simple: quite often, expats come from top schools in their country (yes, this includes USA and UK), have a pampered resume and expect to leapfrog the locals for better paying jobs. Trouble is, these stupid Canadian companies prefer either to promote from within or hire from other Canadian companies, so you have to burrow through a bit to get to good jobs.

 Canadian pay doesn't suck for comparable jobs. Canadian pay does cover living expenses. Problem is, expats often expect too much."

"Rubbish.

The alt-left lying globalist MSM -- e.g. WAPO, LAT, ABC, CBS, NBC, NYT, FT -- have a single goal: a coup against President Trump.

Trump accurately described the events at Charlottesville:

1) A protest group against the removal of a statue which included  despicable neo-Nazi creatures.  Trump condemned them.

2) Extreme left-wing groups, BlM, antifa, WWP, etc, which predictably fought with the extreme right-wing groups.
Trump condemned them.

3) Authorities and police which did not do their jobs.  The authorities should have ordered the police to separate the the groups.  Instead, tragically, the police were ordered to stand down while the extremists fought.  Trump condemned them.

4) The lying MSM media which characteristically used the riot to blame President Trump and conveniently ignored the key role played by left-wing groups in the riot.  Trump rightfully condemned them.

Now the leftists want to take down statues of Washington & Jefferson.

""Where will it end"" indeed."
"Goldberg certainly has a way with words... or possibly a staff that generates similes 24/7.

"According to a former CIA boss, Russia has been interfering in the US democratic process in various ways since the beginning of the Cold War. The recent US Intelligence assessment was that Russia probably tried to hack various US democratic institutions during the time of the last US election campaign. US Intelligence also accused the RT news network of propaganda ""meddling"" in the US election campaign by running stories making America look bad and its democracy look corrupt. 

I just read something I had bookmarked about a year ago. Back then, the Kremlin was saying they have attempted hacking, phishing and malware attacks against Russian govt information systems on a daily basis and many of these attacks originate in USA. The Russians also accuse USA of meddling in their elections through propaganda and financing opposition parties and NGO's. The Russians say all post-Soviet republics have been targeted by USA for election meddling."

"I was a member of Chi Psi in the '90s and it was like any small society: There were good guys, bad guys, guys who blended in and guys who stood out. Decisions made were rarely the best ones, but everyone in general tried to look out for one another and there were always a handful of cool heads that prevailed. Was there hazing or stuff done to excess? Um, absolutely. Albeit nothing that could compare to the first month of parenthood or having to deal with a ridiculous coworker or living through a loved one fighting a terminal illness. In other words, life is messy. As an adult you have to make decisions about how to get through the messiness as well as who you want to be and how you want to live and be remembered. If you surround yourself with people who show empathy, compassion and concernregardless of whether there's a label on ityou'll do OK. If you want to be a victim then you'll be a victim.

"I don't see the word ""conservative"" once in the above column, and that label is utterly meaningless at this point in terms of national politics anyway; a ""conservative"" politician (or media source) would be one who favors the status quo. The present conservative movement is about destroying the status quo, from top to bottom, which instead makes it radical. So I suggest you recheck your labels. ... To your second point, The Wall Street Journal (http://asne.org/content.asp?contentid=354) is an example of a ""conservative"" media source with credibility and a code of conduct it follows, but my column above was not about political leanings; it was about journalists presenting a code of ethics to the world, for everyone to see, and then following it (or facing the consequences with your audiences); this is about accountability, professionalism and honor."
"Wonder woman is ""testosterone-light""?! It looks like the same old smash'em up/blow'em up nonsense that we get from so many male directors in the Hollywood stable. I'm all for women having equal access, equal opportunities, et al.

I get it that Canada has to contribute to defence of the west and the F35 research is the price.  It is my understanding we were to take possession of some F35s at some point in 2017.  And yet again, the program is bogged down in difficulty.

The previous government actually employed the CF18s in military operations in Iraq and Libya.  They were instrumental in helping to destroy Gadaffi's military infrastructure.  They delivered more payload per capita than our allies involved in this conflict, and no aircraft was brought down.  The maintenance of these aircraft also contributed to their admirable service record and long life.  It would make sense to purchase the Super Hornet given the history we have with this machine which is a history of reliability and longevity.  We are a frugal people."

Anything other than that is pure baloney, every other major country in the world pulls the strings with their favorite political candidates of the adversary nation.

Your point illustrates why persons of faith, although they obviously can bring their faith and values with them as they participate in civic and public life, cannot expect or claim any sort of deference or pride of place for their values or ideas in the public square.

That does not mean that so-called ""Value Voters"" have no right to advocate for them; of course they do.  But it does mean that they have no right to expect deference because they invoke their faith or religion when they advocate in the public square."

"That is  what happened to Ancient Lake Ahtna. It was as large as Lake Michigan and covered what we now know as Alaska's Copper Basin. It broke through the mountains near the Matanuska Glacier and roared down to the Cook Inlet, taking a portion of the glacier with it. Huge boulders were left along its path and now look like little mountains near the Knik River flats. Soil gathered along the way was deposited in the area where Anchorage sprang up years and years later. Apparently that soil was unstable and shifted during the 9.2 earthquake of 1964, resulting in devastation to the city.  
I'm saddened to think that the most beautiful lake   Kluane is shrinking. I have always loved passing by or even spending a night camping on its shore.
Years ago the Ahtna people would sometimes travel from Nabesna along the White River to Kluane. There was a tale of an Ahtna maiden who went to Kluane and was never seen again by her people."

So, to your point, countries committed to CO2 reductions in the Paris Accord, but there is no consequence for not achieving those goals.

If that is so, then tell me whether proclaiming that ""Jesus descended into hell"" between his death on the cross and his resurrection is orthodoxy or herterodoxy? If you are uncertain, look it up in the CCC, or ask me, as you prefer.

How we came to profess herterdoxy every Sunday is a very interesting tale. If you care, let me know and I'll explain it to you. It really is a complex story of the meaning of words."

Of course gay people can be fired from their jobs in all fifty states if you happen to work for a Catholic institution, such as a church, school, hospital, or charity. I'm guessing Donnelly College won't be addressing THOSE people who remain on the margins, all thanks to Catholic teaching.

"I am talking about paying dividends - not salary. Current tax laws already forbid paying salary to someone who does not really contribute or paying in excess of market value for work done. Dividends are different because they reflect the VALUE of a business. As a shareholder , you take a chunk of value out of the business to pay yourself. Now Morneau considers that only ""qualified"" shareholders may take out dividends from something they legally own - or face confiscatory tax rates. This is incompatible with the norms of ownership in this country and will likely face legal challenges. Owning a business is not like owning a job. Tax laws must take this into account. That would not strike most business owners as inappropriate regardless of whether you or your kids are male or female or even if you/they self-identify as something else."

"You don't need to dispose of it.  Nuclear waste can be recycled as it is in France, but for some reason we have laws against it dating to the 70's due to fear of nuclear proliferation.  Well guess what, N Korea has nuclear weapons now so who are we really worried about?"

"Oh shut up. Never confuse people of color reacting to white supremacists as equal racism on the part of the black community. Also never confuse the left, who are pushing for equal rights for EVERYONE, as the ones who are perpetuating racism. The left is looking to stamp racism out like a lit match in a dry forest. For decades the race card has been played endlessly by the right as first it was dogwhistle comments but now white supremacists feel emboldened to grab tiki-torches and shout Nazi slogans in public. This cannot continue. Don't like racism? Don't like the antifa? Then tell your side to cool it with the swastikas."
"Yes, there is a reason to continue to define a marriage as between only a man and a woman.  The reason is, ONLY men and women are sexually compatible to each other.   This is a scientific fact of our biology.   That someone may have undergone a procedure, for no fault of their own, which caused their sterility (principle of double effect), or their body is such an age as it cannot any longer produce offspring, is secondary.   Two men or two women will NEVER have sexual complementarity.   THIS IS A FACT!   As repulsive as it is to say, a brother and sister are more sexually complimentary than are two men or two women.  If you are going to base relationships simply on emotions or sexual desires, then you cannot deny consenting adults of 'committed, consenting, life long incestuous relationships.'   I am not advocating for this and am strictly against this, but by YOUR logic, this must also be included."
"Thank God the police shot a white guy, they can have this cleaned up and under the rug  in 30 minutes.  Of course I'm assuming he's white."

"That's 2000 feet above MSL (mean sea level), not AGL (above ground level).  Not much ground clearance considering the location.  Sounding more like a CFIT (controlled flight into terrain) than a mechanical issue.  

Reminds me of a flight we took many years ago in a Cessna 172 to view the last Mauna Loa eruption.  The cloud base was just a couple hundred feet above the eruption site, and commercial operators almost unanimously stayed on the ground at Kona, but we wen chance 'um.  Of course the Mauna Loa terrain is a lot smoother, but we still had a few hairy moments looking for holes in the clouds so we could climb out."
"You're suggesting that because terrorists are inspired by religion, that somehow gives them a pass from criticism?

Where every country with a large Muslim population or immigration is experiencing huge human rights violations, world is supposed to sit on its hands and be quiet, and ignore how radicalized version of Islam have resulted in thousands of terrorist attacks?

I guess that's the argument from extreme progressivism.  But some of us are realists, and we want to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks, even if some people throw the silly ""but you can't criticize religion"" nonsense at us."

I would like to appeal to the locals to not adopt the aggressive driving habits that we're seeing as well. Also, there's no reason to tailgate - you won't get there any faster. Also, Left Lane = Passing Lane and Right Lane = Driving Lane. That is all. Thank you! :)"
"Lots of kids are hated and bullied, some who are accused of being gay but are not, among many other reasons.  The worst I've seen is the bullying of fat kids and the kids with lisps.  That is, the sex acts - of which the word ""gay""implies - have no place in the classroom.  If the schools want to teach anti-bullying, especially to kids of sexually inactive ages, then they should teach about bullying against, e.g., effeminate boys, boys who don't like sports, boys who like dolls, etc....NOT boys who seem to have the characteristics that will lead them to desire to engage in sex acts with other boys when they reach puberty."

Lets say 40% actually find a public bathroom to relieve themselves, that still leaves over eight hundred pounds per day of human waste dumped on our land and in our streams every day!

"This editorial would be reasonable in a reasonable context. However, we are not experiencing reasonable behavior by Trump, far from it.

I would imagine that Yates defied Trump to raise awareness and support the Resistance. She knew she would be fired, and she also knew that in a matter of days Sessions would be the Attorney General and fully aide and abet the authoritarian takeover by Trump and Bannon. 

Soldiers not only must not obey illegal orders, they must protest and resist. Yates followed the same principles.

She chose a combative alternative that was both honorable and savvy.

I'm proud of her and thankful.

So if you are female you are not subject to the same rules that a male entrepreneur is subject to or if you are Trudeau or Morneau you will not be subject to the same rules. This is all part of Trudeau's feminist agenda where males are obsolete."

"So how do you ban a citizen from travelling to their country. You do realise that most terrorist attacks are by citizens of said countries and not immigrants. Secondly, every major islamic group has condemned the practices of ISIS and who do you think is dying fighting Islamic terrorism, they are mostly other muslims."
That's just silly.

"Walker used to promise he could just waltz over to Asia and they'd provide all the money necessary because he'd 'sell' them the gas.

Turned out, none of them would buy any overpriced gas from Walker.

Now he's looking for 'investors'?

That means he's looking for people who look at it as a way for them to make money.

Walker wants his scam.  'Investors' want a return.   We end up paying.

"Well, it is probably the case that Trudeau will not do much to limit foreign buyers.  That might change if many thousands of young Canadians got after their MPs, making it clear they would like to have a chance at a home someday.  If Justin came to believe his re-election was at risk, he might do what he should do anyway: (1) limit foreign buyers via big, national purchase taxes, quantity limits, big taxes on vacancies, and enforcement of income tax laws and money-laundering rules; (2) go further in limiting domestic mortgage loan guarantees; (3) help local governments to enforce zoning rules; and (4) above all, quit letting people who come in under visitor's visas buy property, have babies and stay forever (income-tax free!).  He could allow previous foreign buyers to keep their properties, but limit the future flow, and the market would still go way down if such measures were implemented.  Is JT corrupt or just naive and not concerned with ordinary Canadians?? Who knows???"

"I think you have presented an important component of 21st century grids minigrids. Minigrids are the way things are evolving where there are remote locations where central power is not easy and has not come.  They start with some solar panels and even old fashioned batteries with modern solid state devices that use low current DC like cell phones and LEDs. Low current and low voltage with 12V or 24V which the whole automotive/RV world operates on.
We have DC minigrids now that are in things like sever stations that operate at 380 VDC.  A lot of saving not doing AC to DC conversions both in terms of electrical efficiency and heat n the case of server stations. We need good home wiring and grid standards to allow these efficiencies to be added.
There are multiple forms of storage both at the home level and the larger minigrid level."

"That is absolutely not the largest study ever done on immigration in Canada - not by a long shot. It's a global study meant to compare national attitudes across 20 countries worldwide. The sample for Canada was about 1000 - at the low end for a robust national survey. Plus, the question was not about multiculturalism or even about the impact of historic immigration to our country, but about current levels of immigration, and kinds of immigration, within the current climate of fear. Even then, we ranked number 4 among all the countries included when it comes to our openness toward immigration. Plus, this study has been updated. So. There's that."
"So, manic, depressive, manic, depressive,.. over and over.

With issue like this, you are either for it...or against it. I am against it. You are for it. You haven't began to defend your position which I will presume would be defending the Confederate flag and the swastika but knowing that you have no legs to stand on, you just attack. Some may say that our national flag did the same but the key difference is, our national flag improved to embrace the American ideals as the time went on while the Confederate flag only represent white racism. But if you got a case, defend your position. If you cannot and only attack, then your comments are worthless. You do know the term ""neo-Confederates""? They are talking about how the South will rise again or how the Civil War wasn't about slavery! Some insisted that South didn't fire the first shot of the war. The Russians did it!! LOL!!!"

We watched conservatives trash Obama, a president who was elected twice in an ACTUAL landslide, nonstop since before he was even elected.  You called him a terrorist.  You called him a non-citizen.  You blocked every single thing he tried to do, even when he was trying to rebuild infrastructure and create jobs.

Now we've got your golden boy, Mr. Birther himself, in Obama's former position.  And he's inexperienced, he parades his insecurities for all to see, and he happens to have a tinkle fetish.  We're going to crush this flimsy fool and make all of you watch.  We lost the election, but with more votes, so there's really no reason for us to cooperate.  Next time, maybe you'll be more cordial when you lose."

"Thing is, The Orange One said, and I quote ""Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped'"".

He can't prove that, so as usual he'll just simply insist that he is right and that he doesn't need any evidence to prove his point.

"I don't think we can accuse Fr. Martin of bald-faced lying when he encourages dialogue. I think there are many questions that remain to be discussed by people of good faith, regardless of their orientation, including: 
1) what are the limits of human sexual behavior, of any orientation, in an era of casual sex and hookups? (Is all behavior between consenting adults consistent with the Gospel?)
2) do those limits derive from God or from historical taboos? 
3) if we agree that our society's approach to casual sex is increasingly disordered, is promoting sacramental marriage for all believers a viable option?

"Yes, saw that title on there, got to check it out.
That's what I mean, seems like so long as there's money to be had at the expense of us poor folks, there's always people out there trying to benefit from it.  Outrageous ain't it???
But when the medical profession is greedy enough to stand behind these crooks and just plain evil people, that's when you know something's gotta give. World havoc."

"Why are some sections of highway so crowded ?   No matter what speed we discuss normally that long line is created by the second driver being hesitant or afraid to pass.  Instead of backing off ,way off,  and letting someone else try, the passing becomes more difficult for the following cars in a exponential way.  More often that second driver is female.  I know because I drive the speed limit and have seen hundreds of women come up behind me driving well over the limit and then following me for more than 15 or 30 minutes when there is more than a mile of clearly visible road ahead.   And then the cars back up behind her.  Just the facts ma'am, nothing but the facts.   So what do I do?   I put on my right blinker as if I intend to turn and I veer to the right , and the hypnotized driver behind me wakes up and proceeds to pass.   Remember I said the driver behind me had previously been traveling above the limit and chose to do so again after passing me."

"Loser?  Sure.  O'Leary is also a liar.

Earlier this week, he was supposed to be in Winnipeg for a campaign event.  He missed his plane [which was delayed and left late] and then announced that his flight had been cancelled.  An easily proven lie.

So he seems to have more and more in common with Trump all the time.

Anyway...he is supposedly a billionaire...why does he need to fly Air Canada?  Perhaps, like Trump, he is also lying about his wealth."
"Smoot-Hawley raised tariffs on a small number of goods approximately 6%, in a time when trade between countries was far lower than it is today.  US imports/exports were in the low single digits as a % of GDP.  It's a point of contention, but many economists will point out it didn't help, but was a minor factor in the Great Depression."

"Several years ago, a community-based patch-for-patch exchange protocol was created in North Bay, Ontario. Completely voluntary. Part of launching the protocol was information & education for physicians & pharmacists in the community. Almost all signed on. Fentanyl-related deaths stopped. The protocol was adapted & adopted by many other Ontario communities, & is now law in the province (sadly, the regulations implementing the law are toothless--nevertheless, the volunteer initiatives continue).

My point is this: education & information for prescribers and dispensers stopped patch-related deaths cold. What does that say about the level of education and information that existed previously, especially in prescribers?

We  have known for decades that physicians receive essentially no education, initially or thereafter, in appropriate prescribing of mind- & mood-altering substances.

Until this root cause is addressed, & such training is mandatory, there will be little substantive change"

"From a reader comment in the Boston Globe:

In the last ten years, average number of Americans killed by:

Islamic jihadist immigrants: 2
Right-wing terrorists: 4
Islamic jihadists (total, including American citizens): 9
Armed toddlers: 21
Lightening: 31
Lawnmowers: 69
Being hit by a bus: 264
Falling out of bed: 737
Being shot by another American: 11,737

If you're scared of Muslim immigrants, then you are a coward. Plain and simple."

"A fantasy. If deported these individuals will simply return a few weeks later (Not sure what the going rate is to transport the person into the US and bribe what ever Mexican and American officials that would be necessary, but it is highly likely that family and friends will come up with the money)In addition, I am always interested in how the ""deportation"" would work, since it I also likely that they wouldn't be allowed to enter Mexico. In other words the Mexican authorities would probably just refuse to accept them."

"Your second paragraph, regarding successive elections of conservatives. 
Twenty something million disenfranchised Bernie supporters have had it with the banks, insurance companies and Wall Street; and the Democratic Party.

"The NPS folks are out of touch with reality as usual.  I did the Denali road lottery drive this year.  What really got me were the folks that were running the registration.  Apparently someone told them to say ""Congratulations for winning the road lottery"" to everyone registering.  Think about that.  You are being congratulated by someone who's salary is paid by YOU, for getting a chance to drive on a road that YOU pay for on land that is PUBLIC. Huh?   What idiots.  No thought process with the NPS when it comes to economics, common sense or reality."
"Today's Mat-Su Frontiersman editorial omits the source of Pioneer Home cuts (GOP) and the misinformed blame broadcast to the masses by Sen. Shelly Hughes.

Yes! It matters a lot! Considering all the other details provided, why would the editor omit and hush up this info? Withholding the whole story allows many folks to continue to believe Hughes' nonsense that blamed others. tinyurl.com/k3pnkc8"

Make all the fun you want, but the fact--real, not alternative--is Werenski is a better player.  And deserves rookie of the year.

Laine won't win as he's missed some games, and that's gonna hurt his final stats, but on a ppg basis, Laine is ahead.  But like Werenski, you Your Leafs guys, never see them play, so how are you to know.

But, hey, what bout Werenski last night, eh?  Dominant.  

I mean, c'mon, boys and girls, they're all good, but Werenski plays a tougher position, his team's a contender, tremendous stats.  It's not close.

Boy, what a pack of sore losers."
"For the last twenty five years or so Police training has gradually switched to military style tactics where the emphasis has been shoot to kill. Shoot ""center mass"" is taught until your weapon is empty. The Darth Vader look became Universal with black clothing, black guns, and sun glasses etc. Hysterical screaming is taught to introduce as much panic and confusion to the situation as possible. It is an increasingly violent world unfortunately going to get worse."
"Ridiculous comparison. A civilian who witnesses a crime isn't the same a police officer who is trusted and trained to uphold the law, and given a weapon to do so. Your neighborhood ""person of color"" isn't given a position of special trust over everyone else."

"In Canada the bison, having more brains than politicians and green eyed eco twits, moved southward as their main food source, the prairie grasslands, suffered fifteen years of locust infestation thus denuding the grassland. Admittedly there was some killing of the animals by both the indigenous population and the nasty white man (both French and English) but the dominant reason was no food. Unfortunately both the written and visual media fail to explore the real reasons for the mass migration and perpetuate the myth that the white man was the reason. It never ends."
Too bad there is no one to lobby for The People.
Just like he'll get around to that little leaky border problem after the next major terror threat or attack on our soil.  Very weak.
"That we have any sort of minimum wage at all is a somewhat arbitrary intervention to begin with. Should we have no minimum wage? I don't see many people arguing for that, so why would we assume that whatever minimum wage we have now is the precise, perfect tipping point and should remain untouched? The content of this article only confirms what is taught in Economics 101...the labor demand 'curve' is downward sloping. Wages go up, demand for labor goes down. That the relationship is inverse is already understood. The exact slope and shape of the curve across a local economy is not. Maybe higher minimum wage will encourage more dignified, dedicated and effective participation in the work force and offset it's predictable hard cost inflationary and job reduction effects.  We may soon get a better idea as these policies roll out. At least the money is earned vs a guaranteed minimum income for just existing and reproducing."

"I guess it wouldn't be a day if Tommy the Pollster didn't quote from his lists of polls.

"Until we can have a discussion on the root causes for these students not being prepared for class we will never solve this. A sign on bonus 10 times the current rate will not help.

These students are not coming to school prepared to learn. They usually do not have the educational foundation to start school due to lack of engagement and involvement from the parents, they do not have the supplies due to lack of engagement and involvement from the parents, they do not have the food stability due to lack of engagement and involvement from the parents. The failure of the family unit for this segment of the population. To tip toe around the root cause of the problem insures you will never solve it.

Until the students come to school ready to learn, have an involved support system at home, and have the basic knowledge to start their school journey, no amount of money will fix this problem."
"Someone in this article called the employees (sales clerks) middle income earners? $12.00 to $20.00 hr is middle income? How much more ""disconnected"" can they be? Yeah, I get it - the wage earner gets a $10.00 employee discount but it's a taxable perk.....! Ha !"

The opposition to pipelines opposes all oilsand development, period. They are ignorant career activists (often foreign funded) blind to the hypocrisy of leaching off of Canada's first world services while simultaneously attacking the job creators who provide the tax revenue that fund those services. The recent ""win"" for the professional protesters in the US is purely a political decision from a lame duck President concerned about protecting a legacy highlighted by short-sighted symbolism and disappointment."

"We citizens have never truly occupied the front cover illustration page of the once treasured Saturday Evening Post magazine by the hand and imagination of Norman Rockwell. Truth be known we the average citizen of this nation of inherited freedoms and self governance have never been able attain that level of embellishment. Nor should we be expected to!

Self governance is messy. Requires voices to be heard, opinions to be expressed. Simply put debate among the self governed.  Can not find voice and express opinions without emotion and bias to generate debate. For self governance to be successful there must be debate. Civility would be nice but it is not a prerequisite in an open and free society for debate, not that it should not be encouraged though. 

This nation's Achilles Heel is the continued embellishment by many of ""THE SILENCE MAJORITY "".  Silence signifies acceptance."

"The point of this is that we need to learn from the past...lots of people in hindsight are stupid, that's what makes it hindsight. But there is a special place for racists, for eugenics, for sexism because we hold these toxins even we profess otherwise in our statements. One thing I learned was I was a racist, much better than my grandmother who was a typical Ohioan and a racist, and then better still than my mother, who made a conscious effort to teach her children this was wrong, and I hope my son will be better still...but the toxic legacy lingers. We all know the words, if we pull back our eyelids we get that this is a racist gesture for Asians. We each can choose to be more open, reduce the legacy but it takes time and commitment! And the conversation, not revisionist, is very important. We should never display the Confederate battle flag except in a museum. We should never support the little d's of the world and his dog whistles, and we need to be more open to others.

"The statues in question did not commemorate the Civil War as much as they unified an emerging Jim Crow southern society. Jim Crow granted ideological compensation to poor whites who were otherwise in the same unfortunate economic position as poor blacks.

Poor whites could look at the statues be compensated for their economic disadvantage by thinking, ""Well, we're poor, but at least we're white."" 

The Civil War's existence as a facet of white supremacist propaganda survived Appomattox by over a century. It still survives."

"American voters opted to loath Bill Clinton's womanizing, but as far as we know he didn't rape any of his participants.  What the voters loathed even more was the Republicans in Congress hypocrisy:  Henry Hyde and his ""youthful indiscretions,"" at the ripe old age of 55, Newt Gingrich cheating on his cancer stricken wife while she laid in the hospital fighting for her life, and his second wife recently left him for the same reason.  And let's not forget former House speaker, Dennis Hastert who repeatedly raped a teenage boy and wound up funneling $1 million + to the now adult male.  Hastert wasn't prosecuted for his past raping behavior.  This guy was two steps away from the White House for gawd sakes.  I don't condone any elected officials infidelity behavior, man or woman. tRump has been exposed BEFORE he tries to set foot in the White House.

"How can you say that? I think this guy - and his non-political-elite colleagues - are a breath of fresh air through the whole of Europe. And where he's doing OK - as Corbyn in the UK - is that the youth are behind him. Unhappily in the UK, the old age pensioners and the Empire Loyalist Little Englanders managed to steal a really stupid referendum, but are now feeling the heat from the backlash from the young who now realise how their future was taken away from them. While I don't like Marxism, I totally detest the Numpty/Nasty Party who are run by a bunch of useless Old Etonians and other pathetic public schoolboys, and I feel Corby will not be able to impose any extreme views but will make life much fairer in the UK. In fact I believe the Labour slogan in the recent election - 'For the many, not the few' - has to be one of the best I've heard for a long time. Things are changing, and even as an old geezer I hope the youth win."

"You keep attempting to get away with blaming this entire fiasco on Governor Walker guy who is too paranoid to use his real name but it is not true. What the Governor proposed was a quite balanced plan to repeal the $700 Million gift to the oil industry to do work they would be doing any way, a small income/sales tax combo, increased taxes on fishing/mining and restructuring the Permanent Fund program so that the state could use the interest earned on it's investments to help fund government into the future. Your intentional and dishonest cherry picking is only a transparent scheme to transfer blame for cutting the PFD checks in half that is the only part of the Governors plan the GOP legs had the guts to do. Be honest with your comments or don't bother with them. And why in the name of dog do you feel the need to hide behind an alias? What are you so afraid of?"

Enforcing this law and leaving it as a schedule 1 is going to create more of a black market and money will go to criminals instead of creating BILLIONS in tax revenue eventually right now it is in the 100's of millions easily. Next with everything going in the US and crime like in cities Chicago, are they really going to devote more money and law enforcement hours to stop what? People smoking a little weed?! All that happens is they get hungry laugh and go to sleep. While cocaine being in schedule 2 is way more addictive and has way more negative effects. This can create 10s of thousands of jobs. It can help cities with the tax revenue."

Your Ad hominem attack on 'Trump fans' is considered by every philosopher as the exhausted endpoint of debate.  Or, a childish rebuttal. Humanitarian aid has no connection to providing further financial aid targeted for rebuilding the infrastructure that Puerto Rico has let decay over decades.  Puerto Rico is a territory, one that only in June just voted to become a state.  Prior to declaring bankruptcy in May of this year, they previously voted 4 separate times to not join the United States and to not pay individual income tax.  It is particularly notable that this last June's election occurred roughly one month after their bankruptcy filing.  Until Puerto Rico cleans up their financial books & establishes a pathway to solvency, the current 50 states must consider whether it is humanitarian for the taxpayers to spend money rebuilding Puerto Rico."

"Many Asian women did indeed provide comfort services to the Japanese Imperial Forces during World War II, but I do not believe they did it at the point of a gun nor was it sexual slavery.    Throughout history, military forces have had no problem finding comfort women regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping, coercion or threats of any kind.  Wars create horrible conditions which cause people to resort to often unthinkable means to survive.  For many women, it was the use of their bodies, and there usually was more supply than demand.  I personally witness this during the Korean War and during two years in Vietnam.  Some members of the Imperial Japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex, which, of course, is rape, but I believe the comfort women who served the Imperial Japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near Japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay."

I know people will say get used to it because this type of emotional, agenda-driven decision making process is everywhere, but it should still be condemned and stamped out whenever it rears its ugly head."
"When you ask someone else to bake a cake or arrange flowers specifically for a wedding, you don't intend those things as an affirmation of the union as a good thing?

When ExxonMobil is saying ""stay in this deal it is good for American"" it should be a clue that there is no pain."

Correct me if I'm wrong but that is an average of 59%. Not the 90% you claim it to be.

He's at the level of Justin Beber's worst period.  Of course Beber was 14 at  the time and Trump is 70.  I grew up in the days of a ocassional ""swat on the butt"" for misbehavior.  If Trump had actually been a sibling of mine, he would have spent a lot of the time standing up.  But, I guarantee you, he wouldn't be the spoiled child he is today.  There is a lot of research today on sociopathology......the nature/nurture argument, etc.  I tend to believe sociopathic behavior such as Trump's is primarily the result of very bad parenting......However, once those patterns are firmly in place, they are unlikely to change.  Look at Trump's personal and business history, look at him today.  I think you will see what I mean.

"With some exceptions, most of the people in question are legal refugees in the US who are crossing into Canada because they fear that the American Government will reject their applications and send them back to their country of origin.  They can't cross the border legally because under an agreement between Canada and the US, they'd be turned back.... so instead they cross the border ILLEGALLY, then go find a cop and apply for refugee status. They aren't hiding.

They can't be shipped back to the US because there's no agreement applicable to these circumstances and it's unlikely the US would take them back.  They're not trying to escape custody because they want to be processed as refugees.

The question is what can be done with them... and despite lots of very stupid suggestions, there's been no realistic solution proposed that can be practically enforced.  Most of the angry suggestions on this thread simply cannot be done."

The peril of asbestos, the ""miracle mineral"", has persisted longer than lead or UFFI,  and still lurks in many 20th-century public, commercial, and residential buildings. The danger varies according to material form, but none of it is safe unless encapsulated air-tight or completely removed.

"That's ridiculous. I'm in Tier 4,  having brought a private 403b retirement into State service five years ago. Tier 4's 401K is growing much faster than my retirement ever did at my last employer. What's more, my transferred funds are growing at nearly twice what they were under my last employer's program.

Yeah, compared to Tier 1 which was a defined compensation plan that made State of Alaska retirees into millionnaires, Tier 4 is low-rent, but it is on par with 401Ks around the nation and well-invested. Plus, you don't pay the stupid Social Security taxes which are just spent by the government so there's a real possibility that when you retire, the funds won't be available. Instead, your contributions are wisely invested with a growth rate on the principle of about 6% annually -- exactly what every major employer in the country offers (except in private companies, you still have to pay the Social Security taxes)"

Those who doth protest loudly know exactly what the alt-right stands for, including the white supremacist sub-text. Some cannot face the truth about themselves. So they set up a straw-man to also condemn whites who do not share the racist, white nationalist views of the ""alt-right"".  

Many whites supported a man for president who openly encouraged xenophobia -  xenophobia aimed specifically at groups who do not generally have white skin. They pretended he wasn't saying what he was saying. Denial. This is NOT about the ""progressive movement"". It is about truth and morality - with what Jesus taught. Those who support the alt-right reject Jesus' teachings and the gospels. The SBC is finally facing the truth. Alt-right - a ""new"" name for an old sin - racial hate.

A deep, extended and HONEST examination of conscience may be called for among those who want to deny their own guilt by tarring all whites with it."

"Ms. Cooper's article is ludicrous and appears to me as disingenuous.  She appears to think that Donald Trump will bring in a new era of ""rule by the few who hold all the gold,"" whereas there are just as many alt-left liberals ""holding gold"" as there are conservatives.  She implies Pres.-elect Trump will be a tyrant, but ignores the tyranny of President Obama, ignores Obama's vilification of police and the military, ignores the violence inspired by the dishonest and biased press and Obama's and Hillary's tacit approval of this violence by virtue of their failing to call for calm and peace.

Ms. Cooper is a fine example of what is dividing this country.  She is too ideologically entrenched in liberalism to give Pres.-elect Trump a chance, just as Obama and Hillary are too ideologically entrenched (alt-left) to exercise common sense.  (Not to mention idiots like Pelosi.)

Maybe it is time for Ms. Cooper to put her pen away."

"An open letter to U.S. President Donald J. Trump:

Dear President Trump,

If you really want to destroy Barack Obama's Presidential legacy all you need to do is order your Secretary of State to release the officially suppressed legal finding of the 1989 Department of Justice investigation that the State Department requested into the US government's claim that the US legally annexed Hawai'i. The DOJ investigation concluded that the ""US never legally annexed Hawai'i"".

This means that Barack Obama's claim that he was born in Hawai'i would make him a subject of the Kingdom of Hawai'i and NOT a US citizen, a fact that would make his entire 8 year presidency a fraud !

You could finally claim total victory and be recognized as the BIG WINNER and the US President with the UUUUUUGEST brain in the entire history of American President's.

Don't thank me, just get your troops and federal agencies out of our kingdom by 2020.

heil Trump !

Now, you want to tell me to take a gentler tone?

"The case Jesus was describing was divorcing your spouse to marry someone else. That would be adultery. It does not describe previously failed marriages or cases of violence or alcoholism. He also emphasizes that when someone is married, they are no longer members of their family of origin (indicating that maybe the divorce in question was about social status and family rlations and not just lust). This last statement, shows why this passage is not a condemnation of gay marriage. Rather, it endorses the fact that the family of origin is now in second position behind the spouse, straight or gay. While what Francis is doing is a good first step, recognizing that divorce is necessary sometimes as a divorce rather than an invalid marriage is an adult thing to do, as is recognizing the rights of gays and lesbians."

"To say, ""The Electoral College is one of the last remnants of slavery in the Constitution"" is historically false.  

When voting for president, the framers of the Constitution decided that the states should do the voting, not the people.  Voting for president was to take place by state, so that each state could have its say.  The compromise between big and small states was extended to the Electoral College, so that each state has as many electors as it has senators and members of the House combined.  Big states still have the most influence, but small states aren't completely lost on the national vote.  There is no national election for president, but rather fifty-one separate elections, one in each state and one in the District of Columbia.

Women deserve, from birth, like men, in the Catholic Church, to have the same access to all sacraments because they are equally capable, equally called by God, and equally worthy for ordination as men are, and this is true regardless of the fact that women are just as good at doing all the other things men are equally capable of doing, of which this Cardinal mentioned.

"Building and zoning codes are the chief cause of the high housing prices here. Other problems include the inflated shipping costs caused by the Jones Act, and the higher labor costs caused by the amount of government construction projects forcing up demand.

There are reasons why the public may support various rules and regulations, but failing to put them to a real cost/benefit analysis leads us to problems such as homelessness."

"For me, these games over the last 6 weeks are all morphing into the same game.  The rotation will have a brilliant start and the bullpen melts down.  Or else the rotation struggles but the bullpen holds serve.  More rarely, you get mixed results like today.

But none of this matters, because the offense (minus Blackmon) doesn't seem to understand that the point is to score more runs than the opponent.  This is a talented group at the plate, but they're stranding double digit runners in games where they don't score many runs. Today they stranded 12 with 4 runs.  So yeah, every 10 games or so they have a blowout, but when they need that run the most, everybody swings for the low percentage, high octane hit."

"Well Ronni, how do you think the 9+ trillion extra debt came about? Here, I'll help you: the major cause was the Great Recession, which killed jobs and drastically reduced revenues; next in importance were the two big wars which cost about 3 trillion and counting, with the Bush II tax cuts at the same time. Never before had the US fought major wars and cut taxes at the same time, but GW Bush did that. The recovery needed jobs stimulus which would have created hundreds of thousands of family wage jobs, further stimulating the economy and raising revenue which would have reduced the deficit, but Congress wouldn't allow it.  That was the Republican stonewall. So, Obama didn't cause the Great Recession, he got us out of it. He saved the US auto industry, a million jobs and the revenue that goes with that, no thanks to Congress. Obama got finance going again when overnight lending, essential to business, had stalled. 

Did you know any of that, Ronni?"
"I suggest you address your underfunded retirement deficit to Governor Kate Brown and House Speaker Tina Kotek.  They are both receptive to claims of victimization and have soft shoulders to cry on.  $50 Billion divided by 4 million Oregonians means each person owes $12,500, or $50,000 for a family of four.  But if you stick the top 20% with 70 percent of the burden like we do with the income tax then those 340,000 tax filing households owe a staggering $102,941 per household!  The remaining $15 billion is paid by 1.36 million tax filing households (the lower 80% of tax filers) but the burden is greatly reduced with only $11,041 per household.  Maybe we should all donate our bottle deposits to this cause indefinitely."

3. Quote ""most white Americans don't want one"". Really? You read minds?
4. Quote ""Enduring white supremacist nature of their institutions"" - Some are. How about changing them, rather than blanket blame?

The biggest flippin point about being an American is that no one, no one, NO ONE gets to tell you what you can, cant, or must worship.
Idiot.
And if youre wondering whats at the other end of that video link its, of course, a video of Trump. 

Because we know exactly what he worships."
I don't understand this study. Justin and Christy both say it is good for our environment. They must know right?
"I don't know the naming history; it's not particularly germane. I'm addressing the de facto pain it creates by its mere existence. it could just as easy be the Benedict Arnold Police Department Building (pick any despicable name from our history).

You do yourself and your position, what ever that may me (it's unknown to me what it is or why), a dis-service by being trite and dismissive. Though my opinion is negated for you, not that I think for a moment you gave it much thought, it none the less exists and will persist until rational argument and critical thought knock it down.

"Even more ignorant was the father of Omar Khad. Introducing  his son to Al Qaeda beliefs and way of life has to be among the worst things that a father could do for his son.

In WWII, Canadian soldiers either shot or severely beat child soldier POW belonging to the 12th SS Division (Also known as the Hitler Youth division.) This was after Canadian troops discovered that members  of this German military formation had been shooting Canadian POW. No Canadians were ever charged for their actions.

In recent years, Canadian troops have shot many child soldiers during combat operations in Afghanistan.

Although Canada is trying to do better when dealing with child soldiers, it is an issue that will never be solved in a manner meeting with the approval of all people. 

A lawyers job in our society is to represent their clients legal interests.  ( A concept not taught by  Al Qaeda .)"

THe same with allowing cyclist s to go through a red light if clear......we want to get away from the 4 wheelers, esp the old drivers who cant see their nose in front of their face.

Reminds me of the GW Bush White House spokesperson deriding  ""the reality based community"" and haughtily sneering that the Bush WH MAKES reality.

It's even more problematic when the powerful, like Trump, do not care one whit for reality or facts.  Compound this with the fools who blindly follow Trump seem to feel likewise and that there is a payoff for them in playing along.

And those ridiculous old principles of good sportsmanship should be re-thought too.

"Here's how strict liability works (since no one here knows how to Google). In any collision, the person operating the more dangerous vehicle is at fault. If s/he can prove that the collision was entirely the fault of the more vulnerable user, then their liability can drop to 50%.

This works not because it is always true. It works because it both puts the onus on the motorists to leave their distractions and aggression at home when they drive and because it encourages people to ride bikes and walk. The fact is that when serious study is made of car-bike and car-ped collisions, the motorists are found to be at fault 80-90% of the time, so assigning a default liability is a pretty good estimate.

But that's only one aspect and it's the smallest one. Automated traffic law enforcement, currently illegal in Oregon outside of a couple of experimental locales in PDX, is huge. Motorists never know when or where their violations will be picked up, so they tend to follow the law."

Also, 2000 years ago, the Romans were still a second tier empire. One thousand years ago, Europe had the same economy and population as Africa(let's not forget that gunpowder, the printing press, paper money, etc were all invented in China around that time, a fact not very commonly known). 500 years ago, the Ottomans were the largest Empire in Europe. It is around 400 years ago that Western Europe really took off."

"""The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.""

There aren't words to describe the level of disgust this perverted moniker engenders. This is a twisted tax cut plan for the rich, and a torpedo below the belt for America, just so the 1% can hoard more cash in their offshore bank accounts. 'Trickle Down' economics is right up there with 'Voodoo' economics and this plan will share the stage with both of those failures should it pass. Companies will not repatriate their funds, they will do stock buy-backs and cut jobs to pump up CEO pay and stockholder value. The 1%, and the 10% below them, will not create jobs, they will hoard cash or buy more real estate, yachts, or art.

The hollowing out of America continues.

"How many times does it have to be repeated;

There have been no meaningful cuts in this budget. Sleight of hand tricks, moving small piles of money back & forth between agencies, are not cuts. Pressing the 'pause' button on major boondoggles like the Ambler & Juneau Mine Road doesn't count either. Both projects are still simmering on the back burner. Making minor reductions in the 'travel budget' is a fly-speck on the onrushing windshield of the financial Semi bearing down on us. Plugging the gaping sinkhole of SB21 & Oil Tax Credits should not be done by pouring the Permanent Fund into it. The Three-Oil Circus of the Damned, with the Corrupt Bastards Club in the center ring, needs to be shut down!

In 30 minutes, with information I gleaned only from ADN articles concerning the AK budget, I was able to cut 400 MILLION DOLLARS in expenses. If the clowns in Juneau can't even find THAT much with access to Everything, they need to be thrown out of office!

NO on the Permanent Fund Raid!"

The average of all the G20 countries is .3% so we are below the G20 average and we have lower ODA spend than UK(.7%), Germany (.5%), Turkey (.5%) France (.36%) and Australia (.29%). I completely agree that remittances represents the major flows and Canada could and should do more to increase the impact of remittances by helping to reduce the fees on remittances here in Canada and through global leadership fees around the world. Remittances and FDI are particularly relevant to 'developing countries that are the cusp from low to middle income but for least developed and conflict-affected countries remittances and FDI do not play as significant a role and these are the countries with a concentration of the poorest and aid is needed in these countries."

Regardless of where you stand on this debate, the ""protest"" was nothing more then the players and the NFL thumbing their nose at the president.  It has nothing to do with social equality, blm or anything remotely close to that.It was a show of spoiled millionaires playing a god damned game, not liking what Trump said.
So, to break it down for all of you snowflakes, this is what the supposed ""protest"" was about.  The lefty MSM played up Trump's message and claimed it was insulting.  The players ""feelings"" got hurt and they decided to protest that.  Now the whole country is up in arms and no one knows what to do about it.

"roger432, having spent some time  living in other countries, I`ve seen some significant differences in the way certain health issues are handled. 

For example, in Ontario, if you need hearing aids and your hearing is worse than a threshold defined by the government, the provincial government will pay $500 toward a hearing aid for each ear.   So if you need one aid, you get $500 and if you need two, you get $1000.   You can draw on this once every three years.

The thing is that hearing aids cost an absurd amount for anything approaching the technology standard that has been set for the past two decades for hearing aids.   $4000 -- $6000 per pair is typical.   And there are maintenance and battery costs on top of that.   It`s not cheap.

In the UK -- the government provides coverage in full for aids that are not bleeding edge, but they are of a high standard.   So, they are probably covering up to about $3000 per pair, or something like that.

User fees aren`t all that`s different."
"If you think ""if someone is out on bail or personal recognizance that the courts would come down heavily on that person"" you have not been paying attention to the Lane County jail revolving door for the last few decades.

""Catch and release"" is the real mantra.  

I often post the multiple prior arrests here; many of them also include probation violations and parole violations, much less crimes committed during to jail releases either on recognizance or just by overcrowding.

This is not new!  

I had one decades ago who I talked a Judge into probation for at 10:00 AM and I heard him being arrested on my police scanner when I was on my way back from lunch.  His new crime got him a few days in jail.  The 'Sentencing Guidelines' control that sort of thing, not the Judge.

Or there was the one who was released from jail with a bus ticket to a new job out of town so he could avoid 'bad companions' who shoplifted a carton of cigarettes on the way to the bus depot.  Couple of days extra."

It's why striping, repairs, snow plowing, culvert clearing, lighting/signage maintenance are the first to go.  Opex on this clownboggle would again, cannabalize from Statewide needs.

"Well, I happen to think professional football is mind-numbingly stupid and a colossal waste of money. Yet taxpayers foot the bill, at least in part, for numerous shiny new stadiums around the country. Take the new stadium in Minnesota as an example. Public funds account for $348 million of the $975 million price tag. That's a third of a billion dollars of taxpayer money not going to hospitals, schools, etc. But somehow $10,000 in public funds to support an opera is both misplaced and deserving of scorn? Now, there are many arguments in support of public funding for stadiums...but please bear in mind those same arguments apply to the arts.

It says that he was staying in the Anchorage hostel as a monthly resident when this story makes it clear he was paying $30 a night.

It says ""agents,"" implying agents of the FBI, gave him his gun back, when that obviously wasn't the case.

Two of the more scary parts of this is that he was identified as being nuts in Puerto Rico, years ago, and his gun was taken away by police, only to have it given back there, as happened in Anchorage. Also, thanks to the NRA, its is quite difficult for the police to take guns away from psychotic people in many jurisdictions, especially Alaska.

Let's hope the West will leave the Middle East alone, let them sort out their troubles. The West role is protection, not intervention.

Obama the black imperialist will be gone soon. The question is will his replacement conduct the same kind of policy. The U.S. 7th Fleet is itching for a war with China.

The definition of sexual assault includes rape but isn't just rapenough. You should look closely at the methodology of all statistics, including that 90% one, no matter who publishes it.  As for the 63.3%? One university,  self reported - any statistics teacher would wad that once up and throw it in the trash. 

Sexual assault should be reported to law enforcement, not handled internally by a school. Schools should be required to report accusations to law enforcement, just as teachers have to report suspected abuse. Due process is given by the courts. No one should have rights taken away because they are enrolled in a college. Rights given to someone stabbing a person in front of a cop are being denied to those accused on campus."

"Mike Harris amalgamated 6 very different cities and boroughs into a mass megacity that now wants to turn itself into Cleveland.

The Old City should be allowed to do the things it has always done in the ways that it did, and the ring around the city should be able to do the same.

Sadly, money is now being siphoned out of the Old City for use on boondoggle projects like a one stop stubway to nowhere in Scarborough-- which is going to cost 2 or 3 billion dollars and do nothing to help with downtown congestion, or to move people in the most populated parts of Scarborough. Another $2 billion is going to be blown on moving a little chunk of the Gardiner!!

These are simply insane misuses of money. The road toll idea was equally dunderheaded. Wynne is right on that-- but wrong on not giving the cities a lot more money directed straight at much needed transit."

My wife spent 2 1/2 years at Wrangell Institute back in the 50's.  It permanently damaged her personality.  Almost every day she remembers in horror how she was taken from her home near Nenana and placed with Eskimos that beat her up.  She was only 9 years old and is Athabascan.  If another boarding school is built there I think there are enough people like her to fly down there and burn the place down.

"As Mr. Robinson notes, Donald Trump is a serial liar with his lies both documented and ""validated"" as such.  Yet there are still millions of Americans who feel he's worthy of the highest position in America and the most powerful position in the world.  IMO he is the antithesis of what I want in a President and has achieved his popularity by appealing to the basest instincts of the voters.  I find his popularity a sad testament on the values of a significant portion of our population."

But then the problem for researchers and scientists is that they have to rigorously test and prove their assertions over a wide range of conditions before they publish in a journal. Then the research and the conclusions reached in the paper have to be peer-reviewed and found to be accurate. Next the proposed product has to be tested by industry and found to be economically cost-effective, then approved by the EPA (don't want to put a potentially toxic product out that harms humans or marine animals like some of the current oil dispersants do) and only then might the private sector (in this case oil companies) invest in the technology.

In particular, if they can access a play area for kids/pets, or even for themselves (such as a climbing wall, or putting green or even a simple pond to relax and watch some trout in ). Basically, the airport has to have a reason for them to want to stay, otherwise, they will cut them very short. 

Look at the nice restaurants at DIA. They are ALWAYS full and some of them take 40-60 minutes for a meal. When I flew out of dia nearly weekly, I liked to get their early away, from the house distractions and plan my week. I would eat there, get a shoe shine and STILL have time to look around.

Hello, THERE HAS NOT BEEN a cooling in Vancouver. The idea of a ""cooling"" there is a make-believe fantasy perpetuated by too many talking heads out there.

Look, 8 months before BC introduced its foreigner tax, a Vancouver house costs dozens of times the average annual income. The day that BC introduced that tax, a Vancouver house costs dozens of times the average annual income. And now, 8 months after BC introduced that tax, a Vancouver house costs dozens of times the average annual income. 

So where is the cooling?

There IS NONE.

No Vancouver house sells under a million dollars. Commonly they sell for two million. The overseas money is still gobbling them up, from recent immigrants who bought citizenship (investor immigrants) and as gifts to their kids and by exempt ""students"" etc. The foreigner tax is a ruse and smokescreen!"

This is what has taken down the greek economy as well as other nations. Time to renegotiate and put it in line with other state retirement plans.

"The First Amendment states, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The first freedom is not the free exercise of religion - it is freedom from established religion.

Government cannot change peoples minds; it can only punish them for the content of their thoughts. As Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father, wrote in his Notes on the State of Virginia in the early 1780s:
Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth."
"Give aways. I love it when they call it give aways. What did they give away? They gave away their own money since neither you nor I pay any state taxes.

You call those incentives ""give-aways"" Give aways from what? Since you don't pay any taxes, I don't pay any taxes and were the only state with 50 plus billion in the bank. Its pretty dang hard to use the word give away.  

You can argue (not easily) about the merits or lack of for the tax credits. But when more than half of the budget and 90% of discretionary spending comes from oil 
revenues, its pretty disingenuous to all it ""give-aways"""

Hawaii residents on average are paying 11.27 percent of their income in local and state taxes, according to the Washington, D.C.-based financial website. New Yorkers pay 12.94 percent.

The study tracked three tax types  property taxes, individual income taxes, and sales and excise taxes  as a percentage of total personal income in the state, WalletHub said in a news release.

The states with the highest tax burdens:

"I looked at the plans and read the information, and I don't quite understand some of the reasoning for the design.

1.  How will this help the existing downtown area, which is over a mile away from the proposed new development?  What about historic downtown with empty shops, as well as Kent Station? These two areas should be more connected, and parking improved and added. I love historic downtown!  The proposed new development is not close enough to the downtown area.

2.  The apartment dwellers in the proposed development would walk a mile to Safeway and back for groceries?  Really? I wouldn't! There would be a limit to how much anyone could buy and carry home.

3. Why is the Promenade and development so far from downtown areas?  I see a gap in between--yes, there are businesses along Meeker in between, but not the dine and shop type of places.  And there are some empty lots that could be developed and consolidated to build a ""vibrant corridor"" on Meeker west of 4th and 5th avenues."

Both are unneeded and unwanted in Toronto.

With the subway cars going overland, just as up to 20% of the existing ""subway"" already does, the only change needed at Kennedy Station is to change out the RT tracks for subway tracks. That's it. Less than $50M."

The NYT article said there's no evidence of any criminal activities yet liberals demand a Congressional investigation. Right now there's nothing they can investigate.

"""Which was better for the average American and creating great long lasting jobs? The 40 years after the New Deal or the 40 years after the Reagan revolution?""
.
It won't be ""40 years after the Reagan revolution"" until 2028. The New Deal ended in 1942 (effectively at the end of 1941), so the 40 years after that would run through 1981, and include the chaotic years of WWII and the immediate postwar years. Then there is the issue of what constitutes a ""great"" job. Does a tedious, but well paid, factory job count? 
.
We can look at the patterns of the majority of those periods, however. From 1951 through 1981, net private sector job growth accelerated, with increasing median levels of pay and benefits, and high average job retention. From 1981 to 2009, net private sector job growth slowed (and then went negative), with decreasing levels of median pay and benefits and declining average job retention. The post-New Deal period wins hands down."

A rational response to the twin demands of lower rates and environmental concerns.

However, the advance of technology is rapidly bringing us to the point where many resources are not scarce at all and can be produced with little or no human labour. 

We are going to need a new economic system, one that is able to provide everybody with access to resources even though they don't work  and there is no work for them to do. Some science fiction writers have speculated as to what such a system could look like, but I am not aware that any serious economist has done any work on the issue."

Might comment was and still is that under Obamacare my family's premium increased even though it was NOT part of the exchange. It has caused us hardship and not helped us. 
So for the millions of Americans who had good insurance before Obamacare came along, more people then those who signed up for Obamacare, now either have had our premiums increased or had it canceled and in some cases had previous benifits dropped because of something in the Obamacare law.

"The PC media needs to stop protecting the gay community from criticism.  To any open-minded observer, the gay male life-choice is unnatural and unhealthy, and has created a national health crisis.

Heck they could go ahead and pass a slashed budget and save the whole mess then turn around and appropriate more money by amending the budget anyways.

"""So you are claiming on 4 cases, of any Voter Fraud or Election Fraud in the 2016 election?""
My answer is NO. The report said four documented cases of Voter Fraud. It was not referring to Election Fraud. 
Once again: Voter Fraud involves only the voter, and that's what these studies and reports were referring to, not to all of the other kinds of Election Fraud. It's naive and foolish to think that anyone would take the chance of harsh penalties to vote fraudulently on their own. If they were paid, forced or coerced to vote fraudulently, that would NOT be Voter Fraud, it would be Election Fraud. I agree that there are a multitude of Election Fraud tactics that need to be dealt with. The worst of these tactics is voter suppression and making it more difficult for eligible citizens to vote. We should be making it easier to vote, not harder. How could anyone disagree with that?
But that does not mean that we overlook voting by ineligible voters who are stupid enough to do it for no reason."

"Two ""thoughts""about that.
1. The Creator:
was ""here"" long before Jesus. There never was a ""time"" when God was not among us, whom ever, where ever, when ever. The Old Testament in three words: God with us.
2. Jesus:
furthering the ""Parent""in creation. He instituted the reality of his ""every-where/when ever/whom ever"" redemption on Thursday evening presaging and including his death, somewhere else on Friday and His self-revitilization some where else again and three calendar days later.  Jesus broke/breaks the bonds of place and time. 
There never was a ""time"" when the redemptive act of Jesus, as with the creative sustaining act of the Parent, was not among us, whom ever, where ever, when ever.
Don't understand your first sentence but I am with you for sure on the rest. If it's ""heretical"" then irony of ironies, it's what sustains my faith in God and partially fuels my hurt about church."

"I believe Governor Walker has implored those who want to  cut state spending to give him specific proposals, saying what, exactly, should be cut, and how much.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall any such proposals being submitted.  ""Bloated state government"" is a great campaign tag line, but it means nothing in actual governance.  There, specific decisions have to be made and responsibility has to be openly shouldered.  This is what too many legislators--especially Republican legislators--seem incapable of doing.

The House voted an income tax because it saw no other way to close the deficit.  Borrowing from the state savings account is sheer folly; it's like telling somebody to spend their last dime before worrying about poverty.  The state--i.e., the Republicans--stupidly decided to forego the revenues we were getting under ACES.  Now they propose no new revenue, and keep chanting about ""bloated state government,"" as if that's going to absolve them of their stupidity."

You might be right. KTUU did a pathetic story on a guy who killed an Anchorage cop and who is now free living in Alaska .

It is where the people living around these small places, too small or too far away from major highway that even Walmart doesn't bother to open a store there, shop and buy daily used cheap knick knacks.  If a 35% tariff is imposed on Chinese products, these people is going to get hurt.  And people in these economic depressed places are the strong Trump supporters.  Jobs that promised for them aren't that easily materialize because the cause of the job loss in these region is more complicated than one cause - China.   I don't know the merit of this new tariff if proposed, I just feel there is an almost comical 'cause and effect' for the Trump voters in this part of the country."
"""...actually complicate the delivery of mental health services, at least for a while, because they will have to be separated out from the current Ministry of Health.""
---------
 Creating a Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions is a poor idea that runs contrary to the approach required for a  ""wicked problem"". Suddenly, action on the ground does not have to simply deal with intra-ministry funding lines, it must face inter-ministry funding lines. More administration to deal with program funding lines, cross ministry communication, health authority budget management etc.  It might look good by showcasing a priority, organization theory provides ample evidence it is a backwards step. Dealing with complex social issues requires integration, not segregation.

In Ontario, the government tried something similar when they assigned responsibility for Long-Term Care to Cam Jackson as Minister without Portfolio. It was not long before the LTC function was moved back directly under Health."

"Cancelling the northern pipeline was the right thing to do.  Cutting a new route directly through pristine wilderness is an unnecessary risk given that a pipeline route to the coast already exists.  The logical solution is to expand the existing pipeline.
Offsetting this through the use of enhanced safety standards, enacting emissions fees in Alberta and putting a system in place to prevent and address potential spills is perfectly reasonable.  In the end, the oil industry is critical to our economy and it would take an act of deliberate blindness to simply pretend the jobs and revenue it generates are irrelevant.
As for preserving the status quo.... well, if you want to know how much safer rail transport is over pipelines, I invite you to take some time to visit Lac Megantic, Quebec.  Meet the people there and ask them if they'd rather see oil transported by pipeline or by rail.

"No, because I am a full-time student and my work is considered temporary. If I was able to get into a permanent position half-time (25/hrs per week, minimum)or more I think I would get a 50% reduction or 6 credits per semester. But those jobs are difficult to land, as in order to maintain my housing contract I have to be enrolled in 9 credits and I am not allowed to work more than 20 hours. But then the temp job requirements are minimum 12 credits and no more than 20 hrs per week or face departmental discipline. But I am stuck working this job until I can make enough to move off campus. Currently I pay around 1800/month to live in a shoe box with no kitchen, which means I have to purchase a meal plan.

My only thought  is that Mr. Hertz must be young and has not been exposed to the harsh realities of war. I do not think any of the gore was gratuitous, on the other hand, it seemed quite appropriate and justified. It highlights the dichotomy this real person dealt with when faced with the love he felt for his country and the overwhelming need to do his part to protect it, and his devotion to his religious beliefs that prohibited him from killing others. He believed this so deeply that he refused to touch or even carry a gun in his own defence during this bloody battle.

His Secretary of State's meddling has wreaked havoc in the Order of Malta where a massive, financial scandal is now brewing over 30 million paid into the Vatican Bank immediately after the Pope dismissed Grand Master Festing.

"Good question, LTG.  Where do you get truly accurate information on this?  There are a lot of propaganda mills and spinning wheels out there manufacturing ""news stories.""
On the question of whom we should back  in Syria, there seem to be three choices:
--Assad's brutal, secular, regime,   (Russia's choice)
--ISIS and other Islamic extremists,  
--The diverse collection of ""rebels"". including Kurdish nationalists, democracy advocates and sectarian militias. 
Of the three, the rebels, whom we support from time to time,  appear  generally closest  to Western values of government, though some  have shown a nasty side as well.  Assad seems to attack the rebels as enthusiastically as he does  ISIS, our common enemy.  
It's a mess which defies solutions,  but with this bombing attack Trump  and  the US are now in it up to our knees. Good luck."

"Pope Francis is not a Marxists.  I think the best way to understand him is to consider that he and his family were devoted to Juan Peron, a character that is not well definable in contemporary North Atlantic political descriptions.

That is why Pope Francis is difficult for many to understand and to label."

"Mr. Moyer is categorically wrong. According to the HB1850 description on the official measure it states; Allows transient accommodations brokers to register as tax collection agents to collect and remit general excise and transient accommodations taxes on behalf of operators and plan managers using their services. Ensures that the subject property is in compliance with applicable land use laws.  So clearly, the bills intent is to both collect taxes and ensure properties are in compliance with applicable land-use laws. The issue that many Senators and Representatives have with the bill is that the language was modified at the last minute and may no longer ensure that properties are in compliance with applicable land-use laws. Most believe these changes were influenced by Airbnb and their lobbyist."
"Nah, I used to agree with this but after living in English Canada for so long I've come to see the genius in the language laws.

"A vastly different train. They're both electric but the Shinkansen is super fast meglev and great distances between stations.

We also have an expensive control center for the automatic operation of the driverless rail cars. 20 train in 20 miles for twenty stations is a difficult control problem. But this is a one time cost. Future extensions of rail would not need another control center.

8.2 billion for 20 miles is closer to 400 million than 500 million. Allowing 10% variation for the projected cost would could mean a cost close to 350 million."

"The person taking issue with the Lands Commissioner is an apologist for the Clallam County GOP. I note that he's still going after DNR and ignoring what has occurred lately. Reconveyance and arrearage have been two big issues for the local GOP, except they've not worked out in quite the way they planed. The Clallam County Trust Lands Advisory Committee voted twice against a recommendation that the county request the state Legislature to allow it to take back the management of its revenue-producing timberlands. As to arrearage, Commissioner Bill Peach has said that he ""was satisfied"" with DNR's progress. Glad to see Mr. Hall has discovered the benefits of CLT timber.

But the Vatican needs to take its blinders off and examine it, and recognize that it is the historic truth.  And Jesus did not just have TWELVE followers.  Scripture has the women from Galilee following Jesus down to Jerusalem.  Jesus had women disciples, permitted to sit at his feet to learn, just a male followers were permitted to learn from their teacher [rabbi]."

""  you need not discuss your disability or provide more detail than that. You can have your Service Animal wear identifying wear, but it is not required.

"There is no mechanism in the Constitution by which a state can leave, so there is no basis for the legal recognition of such a move. We've already been through this. It's called the Civil War. The Union never recognized the existence of the Confederacy as a nation. A state could declare that it had seceded and find that this move is not legally recognized by any sovereign gubmit and then, with no recourse to the world banking or legal systems, try to defeat the rest of the United States militarily. Good luck with that. It's at least as likely as convincing 3/4 of the states to dissolve the Union. If you derive some kind of comfort from that remote possibility, go ahead.

The Church does more than ""exist in the world""; it is in fact the mystical Body of Christ in the world.

Our Church would instead be so attractive - because it would ever more be a vision of Jesus Christ - that conversions would be happening by the hundreds of thousands daily.

And not just new baptisms, but our own daily conversions...turning away from the smaller (or bigger) sins, and beginning again with God  - ""converting"" more and more into an ever more perfect image of His Son.

Additionally, most Aboriginal people already reside in cities, and have for a long time, and yet they still tend to disappear and/or get murdered at a greater rate than their female peers on reserve: https://nwac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Fact_Sheet_Missing_and_Murdered_Aboriginal_Women_and_Girls

That certainly undercuts the notion that the problem lays within the reserve community.

To get better education or work, or to be victims for those killers living within cities?"

"The NTSB is absolutely correct here. Years ago they wouldn't say anything about an accident until the final analysis was out. They learned that releasing bits of pertinent information had the potential of creating earlier awareness to situations that might contribute to accidents. It is obviously not legitimate to draw premature conclusions, such as ""pilot error"", on the other hand it is equally unreasonable to censor dialogue on these accidents by both the aviation community and the public at large.

Speculation was negligent maintenance. The accident came up at our coffee gathering, one pilot blew his top, as he knew the mechanic and didn't want someone knocking his friend with rumor. Later, it was confirmed that the mechanic had reversed cables. Unfortunately, between the time it was made official and public another identical accident occurred and that pilot also died. I strongly believe that the second reversal might not have occurred if the first was widely publicized."

"Only if the statistic's go unchallenged.    President Trump has made a ton of unfounded promises that he can't keep, pretty common for most Presidents, none of who keep accomplish everything they want.

We have little choice but to gather statistics to collect the facts.      

What is our choice Motley?   You want to just go with a politicians ignorant claims lacking all factual results (statistics)?   

I don't want to eliminate evidence/statistics (facts), that highlight problems or guide us toward a solutions.   There's always good reason to get second, third opinions.  Statistics are only as strong as the good intentions of the user who decides what get's measured and how good a job of data collection they use.

"I can recall many instances during a year of paying out-of-state tuition for my liberal graduate education at the author's own university, while also accruing property taxes as a recent homeowner, where questioning a particular professor's contention was met with a dismissive talk-to-the-hand rebuke. Her purpose was agenda-driven, and the only thing enlightening was her relentlessness pursuit of that and only that. Unfortunately, she was also a gatekeeper, so refusing to pucker up on demand wasn't a viable option.

Facts didn't matter where twisted perceptions ruled. Some might have called it indoctrination. In her view, she was merely leveling the playing field. On my dime. Turns out she was just ahead of her time branding those who disagreed as either stupid or a loser."
"Well now! It looks like Trump has done the climate change aficionados a big favour.

With his personal rejection of the largely toothless, symbolic agreement where countries set their own goals and didn't have to meet them until 2030, it is now the greatest climate change agreement since sliced bread.

Oh - and the best part is that the Paris accord had yet to be ratified by the U.S.A. congress and senate.

And, all his rejection has done is save US citizens billions of dollars that would have been redistributed to countries outside North America to the detriment of the US economy.

To bad Canada's Prime Minister can't see the Paris accord for what it really is.

Perhaps he's blinded by the camera flashes from all those selfies and pre-planned photo ops."

"At the very least, I'd like to see the GOP leaders in Congress call a news conference, and one by one take the mic and say, ""I'm sorry.""

It's kinda the least they could do.  

It's not like anyone doesn't understand, pro or con guns, that the GOP leadership is responsible for it being possible for the Texas shooter, the Las Vegas Shooter, etc. to get ahold of the guns they used to kill scores of people.

At the very least, they could apologize for the cynical political position they've taken, which has led to those results.

People died because the GOP panders to the NRA-ish gun lobby.   Their votes, or refusal to vote, in order to make meaningful changes to American gun law is a direct reason, cause, and result of mass gun deaths in the US.

There's just no getting around that.  Make those guns illegal and eradicate them, and they are not available for mass murder."
"No its not terrible for the employers budget unless you are too stupid to be able to craft a budget (which having worked in both public and private sector is true of far too many in both)  The biggest 'variable' is whether or not some moron at the legislature is going to decide to not fund their liability to save a 'budget' or 2 or 3. The Second biggest variable is people chasing the dragon of increasing and decreasing future benefits based on current short term results rather than planning on and working toward long term results. That is how you get retiree's that start on consecutive days one of which can retire 5 years sooner than the other with no other change in their situation.

The reality is though the taxpayers benefited (improperly but directly benefited) from making bad decisions about deferring compensation for employees (if you feel that they should be paid entirely upfront) and the taxpayers should be on the hook to fix what they screwed up (via their elected officials)."

"In 1987 I was part of liaison committees that included Parks Canada, based in the Rocky Mountains.  The situation you speak of was evident even then.  At the time we discussed strategies for restoring the clearly older preponderant age class distribution of the parks with clear warning that  catastrophic conflagration type fire would soon happen. We saw this occur in Kootenay park in 2003. Since then parks has been gradually embracing pyral methods to reduce the imbalance.   

I appreciate Parks Canada's concern about keeping access down, wilderness is a vital part of the PArks mandate.   More work needs to be done on public information regarding the healthy role of fire in boreal and sub boreal forests."

She lost because she was a flawed candidate and ran a horrible campaign.

Hilliary beat Trump in votes, take that as a consolation prize and move on, whining about the rules of the EC reeks of sore loser.  As for voter suppression, give me a break.  Voting is an honor and privilege and putting forth the effort is a reflection of that.  Words like hassle, long lines, lack of free time as excuses for someone's vote being suppressed is a joke.  Now, if you have to dodge bullets and gangs to vote then that is suppression.  I guess voters are suppressed in Chicago and LA. Focus on fixing those problems instead of just changing the rules so a Hilliary could win. Bigger fish to fry."

I get higher dividend returns by straying from large caps into more mid & small caps. 

The core of my portfolio remains large cap dividend growers because I target at least 5% annual dividend growth through increases. But I also include smaller companies with higher but sustainable (and sometimes even growing) dividends. 

Examples of these would be Resaurant Royalty Trusts, REITs & utilities. 

Examples

BPF.UN   Yield 6.26%
SRV.UN   Yield 7.66%
HOT.UN   Yield 8.51%
RUF.UN   Yield 5.98%
HR.UN     Yield 6.32%
NXR.UN   Yield 7.95%
FN    Yield 6.91%
KWH.UN  Yield 8.39%
ALA     Yield 7.4%
(or ALA.R  7.25%)
ENF    Yield 6.43%

Some of the small caps listed here come with higher levels of risk so you must do your own research and due diligence. I never have full positions in the smaller ones to limit my downsize, but holding a limited portion of companies like this can elevate the total yield of your portfolio by a point or so without adding (I feel) undue risk."

Yes, Jack Ma, who copied the e-commerce models of Amazon and others and then relied on those original US pioneers being kept out of the Chinese market by his Beijing masters.

Such soothing words from he Chinese leadership. But travel to China itself and it is clear: foreigners and dogs are almost equal in the eyes of the Chinese: almost. At least dogs can be cooked and eaten."

"I suspect that the dude went to the park to sleep it off.  I suspect that if he were left alone he would have done that.  Being abruptly awakened in a stupor, he likely reacted with incomprehension of what was happening and likely feared for his life.  Were it necessary to ensure that he remained immobilized, productive police tactics would have been to quietly place blocks and blow out strips behind his vehicle.  Instead based on supposition of potential wrong doing, the police sought to confront.   Confrontation maximizes the chances of conflict and rash action based out of ignorance, fear, or anger.  

This is yet another example of the lack of respect we have for our fellow citizens.  There were others ways to constructively handle the situation that would have minimized possible conflict.  We simply do not care enough to make the effort.  And we wonder why we have mass murderers?  We teach that others are to be put down if ill perceived."

"Thanks, Pandora 17. It's also worth noting that the murder rates have not been rising in all cities. I can't offer the citation, (last Fall?) but seem to remember a strong  correlation between rising homicide rates and dense populations of poor people of color. Some cities that don't have such concentrations are experiencing stable and declining homicide rates, while most of those that do have these zones of hopelessness have more and more people killing each other.  It seems to be another index of the cost of social injustice."

Comey made notes of his meeting with Trump and right after the meeting told his former FBI friend at Columbia U.He was still working then and also when he testified before the committee a couple months ago. And that testimony occurred after he provided the info about what Trump said.

Also, why is Donald J Trump enmeshing hismself in a UKIP subconspiracy to divide Brits from Europe, anyway? Is this some sort of long-term fascistic strategy formulated to divide and predate upon the Schengen states of the EU?

"Why would the government.  The only way the current government might change the rules is if right wing groups start funnelling money to support right wing advocacy groups in Canada and they actually succeed.  Since more Canadians are on the left than right, most right wing groups are either think tanks like the Fraser Institute or one's that pander to a narrow base.  The Liberals have zero reason to ban this even if they should.  Although to be fair considering the spread, I think the Conservatives defeated themselves.  At most maybe this would have denied the Liberals a majority, but that is questionable even.  Otherwise while wrong, I believe the Tories would have lost in 2015 either way."

"""CU staff have won four Nobel prizes since Cech won in 1989.""

Again the irony of attempting to dispute my comment on an article related to CU sports is unavoidable.
Even the tragic coverage of Rasham Saalam's untimely death likely received more media attention than CU fingerprints on the Hubble mission and Mars Maven. Why because Mr. Saalam was a former CU sport star, sadly without that link little or no mention would have been made. The Hubble telescope has received tremendous media coverage, CU's part in the mission is rarely a focal point of the mission's coverage."

Your very presence"", are inherently racist and sexist, promoting the idea that white men are inherently undeserving simply by dint of their race and gender, and can never possibly deserve their positions, no matter their individual merit. It's clear from her rants that she favors only people exactly like her (she specifies giving up their positions in favor of minority women, not just minorities or women, because if you're a white woman or a black man, you still need to go to the back of the bus to give her your seat). As a non-white in academia, I simply don't see this as true. It's blatantly bigoted. If she's not getting ahead, she likely hasn't earned it."

For profit, privately held mortgage insurance companies but government backed ( if there were losses to cover) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also played a significant role in making things worse.

* How many individuals actively participate in WE CAN (not just on your e-mail list)?

* Are any city staff persons members of WE CAN?

"""assenting"" the head... ? Maybe you meant assassination.

Google ""South Korea Decapitation Strike"" and there are about .5 mil entries.

When President Trump was running for president he told Charlie Rose that killing Kim would not be a bad thing.

Read my 1st post re: your ? about NK ""retaliation.""

The cost would be about 400 million dead and hundreds of trillions $$$ lost if Kim used WMDs on the Allies.  It will be much less if Kim is killed with a missile.

As far as we know, NK cannot order a military strike without Kim's command.  If Kim is dead he cannot order retaliation.  Moreover, all top level defectors have said that only Kim's reign of terror keeps NK viable as a fascist regime.

Once Kim is dead someone better will replace him.

Never underestimate Putin, but he would be happy to see the end of the reckless, fascist, maniac Kim on his border.

President Trump has lite advisors.  They prepare the options and give advice; he makes the decision.

"A strange article.

It begins saying a Vancouver housing collapse would not ruin Canada.

Then, a few paragraphs later,  it says: ""But remember, Vancouver is now on the rebound after slumping in the immediate aftermath of B.C.s measures.""

Hello?

How about some clarity and consistency of narrative in an article?

Here, let me offer a suggested rewrite, with a new headline:

Headline: ""Bank economists talking crazy-talk about Vancouver""

First paragraph: ""If you ever wonder if bankers have too much spare time on their hands, their recent comments may fuel your view. Even though detached Vancouver house prices reached a record $1.83-million in May, meaning year to year increases continuing unabated, some bankers decided to predict that Canada's economy would not be crippled if - somehow - Vancouver real estate lost its luster. Next, they might as well tell us how a huge asteroid hit would impact Canada: The odds are better than all the overseas money somehow uprooting out of Dodge."
"Mark, I will not stand behind a President who has such poor common sense that could lead our country into (another) war, and your plea for your readers to do so is, in my opinion, far short sighted.

Though you remark about JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis ,as some how analogous to the current situation, they are far from similar. While JFK and Khrushchev did indeed have dialog in the background, JFK was also a bright, articulate and thoughtful President. Skills that in the present are generally insufficient in amount, quality and depth.

I would hope that US citizens have had enough chest thumping wars, the last series of which were brought on by lies and deception, along with the pronouncements that the US would win (another guerrilla war-fare conflict - much like the Vietnam Conflict).

We have the best military in the world, and the worst presidents who put them into regional wars what will never be 'won'.

Please keep this type of old, war-hawk rhetoric to yourself."

"I'm still trying to work out what the new flow pattern was supposed to deliver, because it hasn't made getting in, out, around, or through Redmond any easier.

There are now a couple of junctions (in the single lane sections) where a car turning left can logjam the whole system waiting for a good samaritan to let them through, whereas before there was enough lanes to accommodate traffic waiting to turn.

Getting in and out of the shopping areas on the 'islands' between Remond and Cleveland Streets has now become a risky proposition exacerbated by poor visibility and signage.

The only winners appear to be the construction companies, which makes me wonder why this was done, especially when the North/South corridors are where we really need work to accommodate rising housing density (but again, the council just does as the developers ask and permits construction with no thought to infrastructure)."

"NEW YORK, Oct. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The company that gets rid of highly toxic wastes by selling them as a ""product"" to municipal water departments across the country as cheap fluoridation chemicals has been fined $2 billion for gross violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).

Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, is one of the largest sellers of a toxic fluoride chemical, ""fluorosilicic acid"", that cities add to public drinking water. Fluorosilicic acid is described by EPA in the Consent Decrees as a ""hazardous waste"" produced at Mosaic's fertilizer plants. More than 200 million Americans drink these wastes every day. 

Let me repeat this part; ""Fluorosilicic acid is described by EPA in the Consent Decrees as a ""hazardous waste"".

"Cont. Furthermore, I would suggest that they make a commitment to that person and that person to them, so that their sexuality is experienced in secure lifelong love.

A friend of mine just came up to me a send ""just thank God you didn't have sex with her."" He said that because he had broken up with a gf he was having sex with and regularly. He said that the break up was a million times harder because it was not just a broken heart, but his entire body was calling out for hers but she was not there. Sometimes I wish the Church would sell its teaching from the perspective of pure practical advice. Hooking up or having sex in casual relationships is a dangerous game and you are setting yourself up to be really hurt. So i don't think it is wise to ""experiment"" with our sexualities. Better to employ them wisely and prudently."

Obamacare is like a car wreck that looks like it can be repaired, yet the frame is bent making it a total loss. .  Most insurers are pulling out anyway so just leave it alone and let it collapse.

Forcing people to buy insurance only 'punishes' those who obey the law. As usual.  Just like the rabid need to pass more and more restrictive gun laws. Criminals will always find a gun and it will never go through a background check.. Drug dealers, gang members and other criminals aren't buying health insurance.  They won't be penalized as they don't  'show' any taxable income. So they get 'free' healthcare under Obamacare and the rest of us are footing the bill with higher insurance premiums."

"Don't kid yourselves people. They're going to pass this abomination and we are all going to pay the price for it. Those of us with employer health insurance can't even avoid it this time. Even if premiums do go down (they won't) it will be because we are getting less value and will be paying more out of pocket when we do have the nerve to use our insurance. 

But hey, rich people and corporations will pay less in taxes so it's all worth it to upend a major portion of the economy because Obama dared enact a plan based on a model built by Conservatives."

Why wasn't Wynne put on trial? The Chief Electoral Officer for Ontario thought  this pair were guilty and the judge wouldn't even let it go to a jury! This really smells."

"Taxes for corporations have already dropped 50% in the last couple of decades - has that created more jobs and better paying jobs? 
Taxes for working Canadians are more or less unchanged in total. 

25 years ago, 50% of goverenment tax revenues came from corporate taxes, 50% from employee taxes. Now 75% of tax revenues come from employees, 25% from corporations. 

How is the government dealing with the reduced tax revenues? Cutting services to the employees! So we now have corps paying less and getting the same (and increasing their profits) while working Canadians pay the same tax as before but get fewer services. 

And you want to cut corp taxes even further?

Corp lobby groups keep claiming that reducing corp taxes will trickle down to more work and better pay for workers. Hasn't happened before, won't now. Of course, those same corps want to cut health, education, infrastructure, regulations, etc.... but will not tolerate one cent in cuts to corp services, summer job subsidies etc"
"It goes much further than Gardner et al's repugnant and disastrous effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but all the contemporary GOPs pathologies could be seen there: their outright malice toward ordinary people, their indifference to the suffering of their fellow citizens, their blazing incompetence, their contempt for democratic norms, their shameless hypocrisy, their gleeful ignorance about policy, their utter dishonesty and bad faith, their pure cynicism, and their complete inability to perform anything that resembles governing. It was the perfect Republican spectacle.

Glorifying the accomplishments of Castro reminds us of those who championed the cause of Stalin who murdered more of his own people then Hitler. Ideologues yes but ruthless murderers nonetheless. Equating the actions of US presidents to these monsters is laughable but necessary to rationalize their barbaric behavior. The Cuban people paid a terrible price for 50 years. Any progress on human rights abuses since Obama did a deal with this devil? Not much and no surprise..

"The headline ""In Donald Trump's world Canada has to embrace chaos"" is the classic Canadian vassal mind who is always resigned to be blown away by whatever come along from the big neighbor. 

The sound Canada response is ""Canada rejects the Trump world"". 

Sure it's not easy but we have virtually the entire world on our side. Together we can reject the Trump world. Effectively, solidly. Let this be our policy. Let's go and play global politics to make it happen. Let's be part of the reject Trump movement, be its leadership."
"All that's needed for that is proof that these bishops absolutely knew that the perpetrators of this abuse were not curable.  That is, that these deviant priests cannot change their orientation.

Prevention is a nice buzz word, but do something now.  This sounds to me like 'lets kick this around for the next ten years'.  That is unacceptable.  Great to think forward on this issue, but there are people in poverty now who desperately need a leg up.  That is a travesty in this country."
"Yep, ""the President"" carries bolt cutters in a black backpack and steals bikes that hard working young people buy to get themselves to work--his crew have them stripped to unidentifiable parts in minutes and they get a few bucks for something the owner paid hundreds for.  It is pretty discouraging when this smug junkie profits from young folks trying to do the right thing in life.  By the time the police have been notified any evidence is gone except the videotapes....and that isn't enough for an arrest.  Seems like ""the president"" and his cronies know just how to use the system to get what they want.  
Their behavior is incompatible with shelter living or working for a living.  They don't want to live by anybody else's rules no matter what the benefits.  Yep, I'm angry."

Allowing it to influence or change your humanity to provide for your people would reward those same evil cowards.  Your life has been well lived; No need to change it for faceless, ignorant misusers of the technology allowing all to be connected.

If only the party were unbeholden to a base of drooling cretins. If only the Republican party weren't a threat to democracy itself, the American people would not be duty bound to destroy it utterly in order to avoid humiliating itself not just to the world, but to its own conception of itself.

No worries. I guess Boeing nor the White House calculus have taking into account Chinese interests buying out Bombardier 10 on the $ when it's on the verge of bankruptcy with all IPR and knowledge being transferred  la what is today described by FT's very informative article in these regards: 'Chinese deal with Ukraine defense group raises hackles' in Washington. China will have an instant ready-made solution for its domestic internal short-haul aircraft needs. They'll then finance other countries' purchases of this fine Canadian conceived and developed aircraft. No worries ... Boeing ... no worries Mr. President Trump.
"Not that law enforcement really cares about these kinds of issues, usually claiming they are to busy, here is the real law. 42-4-1206.
 Unattended motor vehicle
No person driving or in charge of a motor vehicle shall permit it to stand unattended without first stopping 
the engine, locking the ignition, removing the key from the ignition, and effectively setting the brake 
thereon, and, when standing upon any grade, said person shall turn the front wheels to the curb or side of 
the highway in such a manner as to prevent the vehicle from rolling onto the traveled way. Any person who 
violates any provision of this section commits a class B traffic infraction."

"Liberal thinking? A Liberal refrains from thinking outside the box. While a Conservative would be damned to do so. But, a Socialist...that's what they do. They think outside the box. Let's say we cut the budget to the extreme. We essentially take a pound of flesh from the system. We would still be in a position of exhausting our State's savings. In no time, the savings will be gone. Why? Because the proverbial ""shit happens"" and we can not predict when it will happen. Wildly unpredictable things may become more usual than we dare to face. That's the conservative logic that oozes from my pores. With no money left in savings, how do we fund the essentials? Answer: Taxes. So, what has been suggested by folks on all sides is that we take a preemptive strategic position to cut and tax...simultaneously. Negotiate to make it so. We see three options.

"No two people have the same reason for not wanting to be teachers or for leaving the teaching profession.
My best friend when I was growing up, and best man at my wedding, got a teaching job right out of college. He lasted one year. He was a terrible teacher. So, he quit teaching, joined the Marines, and became a decorated F4 Phantom fighter pilot flying combat missions in Vietnam. He retired from Delta Airlines after 30 years as a pilot with a spotless record.
My friend was a great pilot but a terrible teacher. Teaching is not easy. Many people just can't cut it, even fighter pilots ... that's one big reason for our teacher shortage.

"IMHO, both yes and no. 

Yes, the scientific method brilliantly actualizes the innate structure of the human mind  which Bernard Lonergan (Insight, Study of Human Understanding) elaborates as the three levels of consciousness involved in knowing. On the first level (Experience) we are merely aware of data; on the second level (Understanding) we have insights into that data, generating hypotheses, understandings, ideas that might explain the data of Experience; and on the third level (Judgement) we evaluate the understandings, hypothesis, theories generated on the second level with a view to determining which, if any, might be true or more probable. 

Science limits the data it considers to the external data of sense, but we also have internal data, data about our own inner, subjective experiences. The humanities in general consider this inner data as well as external data; and mystic discernment involves striving to understand that component of the internal data caused by the Spirit."

"While homosexuality and gender dysphoria may have been occurring in nature during the pre-Decalog epoch, the human concept and understanding of sexuality was still evolving from instinctual animal behavior.
""Adam"" decided that ""this one shall be called 'woman,' for out of 'her man' she was been taken.""""Eve"" became the ""mother of all the living."" Sexuality, animal and human, was focused on procreation and survival. (Gn. 2:23, 3:14-20)
""The tradition of the Church has understood the sixth commandment as encompassing the whole of human sexuality."" (Catechism of the Catholic Church #2336)
Church teaching has emphasized the indissoluble bond of one man and one woman, but the essence of the injunction against adultery still considers monogamy and heterosexuality as ""property rights."" The Church defines and confines the right to ""suitable partnership"" to man with one woman for life. Death extends the survivor's right to another ""suitable partner.""

"The researchers said: The scenarios  which include a wave of anti-globalization, a severe earthquake, steep oil price declines and a massive housing correction  are all chosen as worst-case events and are not forecast to actually occur.

The researchers said: The agency forecast Canadian house prices would fall by 31.5 per cent over the next five years under its anti-globalization scenario as unemployment levels in Canada spiked to 15.3 per cent in five years.
A commenter says:  if we get to 15% (unemployment) try a 50% drop in prices

You will find nitwits arguing that a pipeline is the safest way to export the oil.  The question ignored is, who does the oil belong to?  I say that the oil belongs to the people.  Nitwits say we have to move huge amounts of oil.  Why, on God's green earth, why?  We have a glut of oil right now sitting in storage tanks.  Why not leave the oil in the ground for now, the best storage?  Why drain every drop of oil from the ground in record speed?  How stupid can you get?  The Indians are the only ones showing intelligence and restraint in this situation.  Many white people agree with them.  The authorities say they arrested dangerous protesters.

"""Dialogue is not a dirty word; it's our word""
As a public servant, I recall vividly being followed in a large group presentation by a wise man. He began his with these words: ""Beware of well-intentioned bureaucrats.""  He was right of course. A ""light""...even a dim, itty-bitty one... in a field of darkness is as much or more a warning of what lies unseen, in opposite, in opposition, as it is a beacon.
Let's be real. ""Dialogue"" is not the mantra of the Roman Catholic Church. It may be rampant in its diplomatic corp for mutual institutional advantage, or with justice systems, with its people as pawns. It is certainly not the ""word"", ""spirit"" or mantra of successive Popes since John XXIII, of hierarchy.
Absolutism, infallibility, legitimate teaching authority, compliance and submission are more properly ""our words"". Ask anyone.

Thank you for grounding your opinions about the present in a factual account of history, including the white-supremacy that permeated the USA 

This racist worldview led to innumerable injustices large and small, from genocide and ethnic cleansing of native peoples, to centuries of brutal state sanctioned enslavement of other human beings for profit, to colonial conquest of non-European nations.

This also included Hawaii's bayonet constitution, overthrow, Republic and territorial oligarchy. As you note, it betrayed political, moral and religious ideals of justice,  equality and human rights, and for the islands, it was a great setback.

lets be brutally honest.  The western world is too self absorbed to have children.  The people that want to have more than two children can't afford it due to all the money that goes offshore.  So selfishness rules the west.  And the ones who bleat about immigration are too stupid to see that if immigration is not advanced they will be the ones left to die alone.  But of course it's a vicious cycle that they can't see what is important to them.  Down south the republicans are working to repeal the ACA and create the death panels they railed against.  So they voted out of spite because they don't like people different from themselves.  In Canada we have the education and critical thinking necessary to keep us the greatest country in the world.  If Kellie wins we can rest assured that for many elections to come the  conservatives will serve as opposition and Canada will remain the best country to live in.

"I saw Arnold Chan's moving speech.  It brought back a time when there was mingling, congeniality and even friendship across party lines,  MPs regularly spoke without scripts and talking points and ministers answered questions with a degree of honesty and substance.

Sadly, those days are gone.

The House has reached a new low under former drama teacher Trudeau who inherited his arrogance, stubbornness and disdain for parliament from PET and has neither the intellect nor inclination to answer questions with anything but a handful of prescripted generic non-answers that inflame opposition and embarrass government MPs.  His cabinet greenhorns and lightweights follow his dismal lead.

Trudeau looks for new ways to limit his uncomfortable, embarrassing exposure as an empty suit in parliament and to further marginalize the institution.

And new opposition leaders will make Justin seem even more inadequate and anxious to avoid the House.

"I have not seen much comment on the fact that St. Augustine had an erroneous translation from Greek to Latin of Romans 5:12-21 on which he based his theology of original sin. Jerome was an excellent translator of scripture from Greek to Latin, but he did made a serious error in the translation of the verse mentioned and provided it to Augustine, who could not read Greek.   The Eastern Church early fathers used the original Greek epistle of St. Paul and so the Eastern fathers' theology of original sin, which differs from the West, is supported by correct scripture and not based on a faulty reading of the Romans 5:12-21.
The Calvinists also strongly rely on St. Augustine's theology of original sin, which is, as mentioned above,  based on incorrectly translated  scripture."

The National Firearms Act has been modified many times since 1934, but Machine Guns (of which Assault Rifles are a sub-set) have continually been restricted (not necessarily illegal, but there is a robust approval process) since then (including today).

Interestingly, the Liberal Legislators who introduced HR 4296 (Sen Chuck Schumer was one) dubbed the new Legislation the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.  The use of the label Assault Weapon was used to intentionally confuse the public.  The tactic worked, and very few know the difference between Assault Weapon and Assault Rifle.

"So we voted for this person? She knows whats best for the city? Im so glad we have people that are in office that tackle the big issues like declawing your cat 

Who cares about the little things like education, crime, taxes"
"Man the internet must really be your enemy? Making a Dumb statement like that? Here ya go, this was 25 yrs ago.......1992 Denver Klan Rally Sparks violence at Denver King Celebration. and the Denver post still has the original article online..sorry to burst your ""pretend it doesn't exist"" bubble...Colorado Native?? a Joke"
"Pierre Poilievre was my MP for what seems like an eternity before he scuttled away to a safe Conservative seat on riding redistribution. His newsletter were the most horrible travesties, in one of the early ones he had a questionnaire about one of Vic Toews' notorious pieces of legislation (""Do you stand with me or with the child pornographers?"") the question Poilievre asked was something like ""Do you agree with Minister Toews or do you agree with Liberal Senators who would allow sex with telve year olds?""."
"And now look at what a fool you look like.  http://nypost.com/2017/10/19/vegas-security-guard-was-pressured-to-give-interview-to-ellen/
He was pressured to go on Ellen and to avoid tough interviews so he wouldn't be pressured about the timeline because it could open up MGM to huge lawsuits.  Just as I predicted, MGM was behind this and wanted to avoid him saying anything that would be in line with the police timeline.  Just admit that you are not very smart."
"As a former Committee Chair, Den Leader, District Trainer, Scoutmaster, etc.  I have experience similar Parents who want to 1) live their lives thru their children 2) use their children as means to express their political, social views and the expense of the Community.  Most disappointing was a Parent who wanted to have her Scout pass a requirement by ""knowing"" the requirement versus demonstrating.  Specifically ""demonstrating how to tie a square knot"" versus ""knowing about a square knot"".  My appreciation for those Adult Leaders who deal with these issues and properly address same.  In my opinion, it is important to have everyone understand the expectations of Cub Scout / Boy Scout as they make their way thru the program.  We don't need to have these young men go thru the program of what we call ""paper requirements"" or rubber stamping.  It does get tougher and perhaps that is part of the reason that only 5% - 6% make it all the way thru the program and ""earn"" the rank of Eagle Scout."
"Your just a special kind of stupid aren't you , or subtly making fun of the Trump turnips . If it's the latter please continue"
The women is an IDIOT and if left in office she will destroy German identity.  She like many Germans still feeling guilty for what the Nazi's did to the Jews and they think that taking in Muslims by the hundreds of thousands will erase that guilt.  WRONG  most Germans alive today were not born when the Nazi's were killing Jews.
"You miss the point.  Today's techno-financialo-technocrats who determine economic and immigration policy identify as progressives, yet they are the ones who benefit immensely from job-killing trade deals and mass immigration, legal or illegal, while the Canadian working class takes it on the chin, its wages driven down by competition, either from countries with pitiful salaries OR visa workers OR illegals willing to work for whatever.  Because encouraging profits of large corporations and their shareholders at the expense of the proletariat is now progressive and left-wing, and willingness to defend your country's workers populist, right-wing and RAYCISS.  The rabble impacted by these policies?  Pfft!  They probably think bathroom policies for trangenders are not a major concern.  Let them eat cake!"
"It is not the elimination of differences that builds a strong society. The elimination of differences is a sign of weakness, totalitarianism and fascism. Only in acknowledging and embracing differences can we overcome discrimination. So, the problem is not the identification of gender, it is the discriminatory treatment of different genders. Getting rid of gender identification in government identification, or in language, or in how one  raises their child will do nothing to reduce discrimination based on gender."
"The Chinese President must have complimented Mr. Trump's hair.

This after Trump railed for months about how China is ""raping"" the U.S.

Trump is a psychotic."
"Clearly Konrad pines for the good ole days - when a prime minister would be known less for his platitudes and more for waging war on Canada's democratic institutions. He misses that dark period when independent watchdogs, the CBC, the Elections Act, the Supreme Court, and Parliament itself all became enemies of the state. An era in which government thrived on divide and conquer tactics - pitting region against region, haves against have-nots, and public opinion against any group or institution that could be used as a lightening rod to deflect from the ineptness and arrogance of their own government. 

Konrad grows tired of the calm - this era of tolerance, inclusivity and mutual respect. He looks south of the border and sees how entertaining, even exciting politics can be when you put a cat among the pigeons. Konrad would have us believe he is a 'neutral observer' in the desperate search for just the right cat. I think not!"
"I make facetious statements because the odds of offending people with my true feeling of disgust towards perpetrators that victimize some of the most vulnerable is subdued. I've seen a 76 year old man, on his deathbed, bawling like a baby trying to tell me how he was molested in his church as a teenager. He lived a bitter life and blamed God for what happened to him. It wasn't God, it was man's free will that did this to him. I've met people that have molested children, even claiming to be teaching their children to be sexual beings. Another was a youth leader in his church taking pictures of the young boys. His own wife turned him in.  I've seen the damage these perpetrators do to people. I refuse to have sympathy for them!  These people are disgusting people. 

That's why I choose to keep my remarks short. I'm angry and not feeling too loving towards these people."
"Agreed Bill!  And with the idiots who pass for ""traffic engineers"" nowadays, they'll probably try to paste 10 or 12 roundabouts into any future highway-to-highway connection.

I have spoken to Anchorage area traffic engineers on a number of occasions in the last 10 or 15 years, and their consistent lack of common sense, and neurotic obsession with sticking to rigid formulas and 'uniformity' of design, even when local conditions dictate otherwise, was and is truly shocking and actually frightening.  

Just as one example, I have always been shocked by the ridiculously short 3 second yellow lights in Anchorage, when I had always seen 5 or 6 second yellow lights elsewhere.  Not only do they force drivers to break unnecessarily hard in DRY weather, they lead to innumerable slides through yellow lights in the winter, and drivers constantly 'running the yellow', something I had rarely seen before living in Anchorage.  But just try telling all that to a clueless local traffic engineer!"
"General Kelly now has to do a high-wire act to keep his job. I wish him well, and I'm certain he recognizes the difficulty in dealing with a powerful man who appears to any casual observer to be crazy.

As the writer Catherine Lucey points out, the economy is steaming along at the same rate as the last year of the Obama administration, no more, no less. Wall Street still has the longest bull market in history, but a correction will come, and maybe a bear market. The president whether Dem or Rep has little to do with the markets, unless he instigates a disaster. Health care ""reform"" seems to be dead for now, but ""tax reform"" a la Republican Congress is likely to be a monster.

We are still in for a rough ride with rude company."
"Until marijuana is legalized nationally, they will not be able to stop this......  it's in demand in every state of the union, and the government needs to recognize this and actually regulate weed just like alcohol and cigarettes.  It remains to be seen how many are actually convicted of the crime....."
"80% of is fur comes from farms that are not humanely raised and slaughtered animals. Why would modern day, eco-friendly people be interested in that? If you are subsistance and use the entire animal and humanely kill it in the wild, that is completely different and native culture. The fur bikinis sell because they are a joke you can take home to the wife. Otherwise, no one wants to advertise that they are okay with killing inhumanely."
"Dick,
Don't call me bro, Dick. There is nothing remotely similar between the two of us which could be confused for being related. Unlike you with your random negativity and dumping on UAA hockey here on ADN pages, I spent more than 10 years touting the UAA hockey program's positive aspects and supporting student-athletes who don't effing get paid. The last thing I'd want to be is your bro, Dick.

Regardless of the future of this program (and nothing is set in stone, Dick) I'll continue to show up here on ADN to counter your ignorant and hateful comments against UAA, Dick."

"How does a nuclear sub or bomber stop a ""lone wolf"" isis inspired jerk blowing up a stadium?

Time and time again I hear you folks bleating spend more on defense to protect us but the only country really that threatens us on a strategic level is your new buddies the Russians.

And North Korea?  We have more than enough weapon platforms to turn that country into a wasteland."
"Randy, you wrote:  ""Jesse Farmer - Like all your other comments, this one is completely unsupportable ""

You have never read a single article in the PDN --  including this one.  You just go wherever Google Alert ""fluoridation"" sends you and write scripted responses to other commenters there.  You know nothing at all about Jesse's comments as a whole.

Too bad  --  you were really doing unusually well at staying civil, at least for your first couple dozen comments here."
"One can readily discern why Dearest Choon and curt Curtis are soul mates. They both commiserate with what has aptly been described as a ""basket of deplorables"".

"My factual rebuttal is that you are a racist and a xenophobe. For evidence, I refer you back to your comment.

If you need help figuring it out, it's the parts where you call Africans ""children"" (amongst other things) and suggest that the only good part of Africa is the part that has been ""Europeanized.""

You, ""sir"" are a racist and a rotten person. QED."
"The Democrats that started the Vietnam War and then expanded it, Kennedy and Johnson never talked either austerity nor fiscal conservatism. You really should educate yourself before posting things that only make you look silly."
"Or they got fed up with the riots that BLM sponsored. Racists are disgusting, no matter their skin color."
"You state....""Those Keynesian economics will be a massive failure to everyone who applies them, yet those who still think deficit spending will work."". Gosh. Correct me if Im wrong. But with the 2008 financial collapse, most countries in the world,including the Harper government, put trillions of dollars into deficit financing,into stimulus, into quantittive easing.And those expenditures are credited with saving the world from an entire economic collapse. But perhaps you forgot these basic facts, or dont really know some very basic facts about international economic history."
"maybe the guy should not have come out shooting at people who had a valid reason to be there. and, he was notified. these jerks who claim they were not notified are lying. fact."
"How ridiculous, they were blaming Comey for screwing up the election for Hillary last fall and calling for his firing!  Now that Trump does what they wanted they are out protesting. Of course."

"Everything at the airport, is about money, and political retaliation.

Now, the airport security, will have to make the arrests & detentions, until the police arrive, and to possibly pick up the airport criminals who were arrested.

A new legal can of worms, has just been opened."
What a disgusting state of affairs. It's just stupidity amplified.
You must have intended to reply to JSB1. My post was a response to JSB1.
"That caused me to laugh and shake my head in equal measure, Marelise.

"How many non-unionized fire fighting departments are there?  For many jobs, if you want to work, you have to join the union.

It seems to me that this is the sort of abuse that unions were created to prevent."
"The Governor and most residents recognize illegal vacation rentals are harming our residential neighborhoods. Instead of contributing to the problem as the current bill will do, the Governor is saying the bill should be rewritten to help the City and County shut down the illegal operators. Hopefully the legislature will do that! If they don't, the Governor has pledged to veto it!"

Eisenhower was more worried about the military industrial power base and quite rightly as it still has a death grip on the US economy.
"Boozer: tompaine2 makes a very good point here.  Often the ""rich and successful"" believe they're really special.....some would use the phrase ""Hot S@#$"" .  The MW's on-line dictionary reads..  ""Simple Definition of hubris : a great or foolish amount of pride or confidence""  You take two parts Anger, combine them with one part Hubris, and it often produces really ""stupid"" actions."
Who gives a rat's behind what tRump thinks.  It's none of tRump's business where President Obama was born.  Besides tRump illegally pushed his fourth wife's immigration papers through without her having to go through the immigration high jumps that all other immigrants have to go through.  Someone in authority needs to rip this allegation wide open and then hang tRump for lying to the voters.  tRump can't keep his pie hole shut.  I hope he keeps cramming his foot in his mouth up to the November elections.

"No, that's not good news -- because Donald Trump -- an emotionally unstable, corrupt, incompetent, bigoted blowhard -- is."
Trump is a sick man.  I am utterly disgusted with him and anyone who could possibly support this monster.
"Attaboy. No one should have to ask. That's really some major legislation, there. So is he going to sign the Russia sanctions bill? Unlike the garbage he has signed, that one would actually benefit the United States, the country he pretends to lead."
If black people cared about black lives. Then they would spend their time and energy getting black people to stop killing each other.
"Some moderate democrats (and by proxy republicans) did not support the progressive provisions the public option and expanded Medicare, and they were removed to pass the ACA. Instead the ACA was modeled after Romneycare, passed by Republican legislators in Massachusetts opposed by most state democrats. Had the ACA been modeled more after counties like Australia and Germany, with a public option and much lower administrative costs, rather than Republican legislation, it would be more cost efficient. But that would be socialism."

"I'm quite aware you think I can be dismissed, and your taunts don't bother me.   The 'White House Election Commission' may be public, using public money, but it is a private effort by Pres. Trump, to find evidence to support his claim of voter fraud.  That has been investigated and found false, and the data has been published.  I believe Trump's claims of voter fraud are part of his  distraction plan.  He can't seem to accept that fact he is president, which is a bit odd, but his ego needs to think everyone loves him.  He is using 'voter fraud' to distract from the Russian hackers and the possibility they helped him win."
"Rail recovery plan from what?  Caldwell incompetence, Ukeleleblue incompetence. Poorly planned, poorly designed, poorly

Talk to any police officer and ask them if they'd rather deal with people under the influence of pot or the influence of alcohol. And hopefully you've a sufficient grasp on history to avoid beating the prohibition drum as well.
"Respectfully, Trid, I don't often engage with you as there is zero hope of understanding or agreement.  Your vision and understanding of the RCC and all of its doctrines and practices froze solid in place before Vat II, whereas I was fortunate to be tutored in the Council's renewal of thought, developing theology and flourishing of freedom and imagination -- and not by wackos or ""dissidents,"" but mainstream and holy priests, bishops and educators.  We are roughly the same age and were each raised in the Traditional Church.  I embraced the post-Vat II Church, which you don't recognize.  That's the difference.  I also feel obligated to call for ongoing reformation of areas I see  as sinful (misogyny, etc.), which action you see as her*tical.  I see your refusal to change with Vat II as scandalous as you see my ""dissidence.""  Peace to you."
"Hey STD (how long did it take you to think of that name).  You're a riot.  Funny how only you MAGAphants call this a success list.   You brainless lapdogs are so easily distracted from the real news.  It is hilarious to watch.  Keep it up.  BTW, I know people at the EPA, because of Trumps idiocy, there is no slowdown on enforcement.  While Trump is busy firing west wing staff, the environmental bureaucrats are doing just fine."
"From your reply it appears that you've never served in our country's Armed Forces, so your reply was childish and without merit. you've never walked in our ""boots"" so maybe you should change your moniker to ""Sneakers""..."
"Is what I still don't understand, the gays have a right to marry, but, why should she not have the right to protest what goes against her beliefs? There are people from the middle east afforded their religious beliefs, yet, she can't have hers? It may not be everybody's belief. But, it is hers."
"Kapernick is GONE--the NFL got rid of him--and no one even knows what he is doing right now.  This was just the typical Trump show--that he does all of the time.  After you  burn all your team gear--he'll get bored and go off on a rant toward another American entity, another American citizen and you'll be boycotting or burning something else.  He does it for ATTENTION.  We have never had a President in this nations history, regardless if you liked their policies or not, that didn't act Presidential.  Trump can't act Presidential, no one can control his nacissistic personality disorder.

It's clear that these players took a knee to protest his disrespect toward them, calling them SOB's and stating they should be fired. Regardless of whether you like what they're protesting or not, they have the right to protest whatever they want.

Trump is a National Disgrace."

"Just more examples of the traitorous ideology now dominant in the Republican Party of traitors led by a 1930s Germany heir following Mein Kampf to the letter.  A Republican party formerly purported to contain ""moderates"", but hasn't contained any such since WWII.  The true nature of the Republican terrorists determined to destroy the U.S. Consitutional Republic forever to be replaced by their Corporate Oligarchy ruled by a Board of Directors will all power devoid of any democracy in any form.  Time for a full Revolution to save what's left of the nation."
The Democrat Party hasn't even come close to meltdown compared to the Republican Party.  I don't believe Hillary is the best candidate that could've come out of a lineup.  Too bad voters didn't push Sanders over the top.  If that had happened we'd be looking at a totally different presidential election.  But we'd still be stuck with Trump sexual meltdown.  That'll never change.
I suspect that we can expect a few more of these between now and the new year.

"Your numbers look like they come from the utterly discredited book ""From Time Immemorial."" There was no where near, not even close, to 40% Jewish population in the Late Ottaman period.  Utterly laughable and Trump like ""alternative facts."" Give me a footnote.

A Palestinian identity had arose in the late Ottoman Empire.  The term Palestine had been used since Aristotlelian times.  The Palestinians have an unbroken occupation in Palestine.  Genetic studies show that todays Palestinian are related to the biblical Jews.  Which makes since, since they are the indigenous people of that area.  The Ashkenazi Jews came from Europe in a colonial enterprise to usurp Palestinian lands.  Too bad they cannot accept a glaringly good deal and take 78% of the land.  Instead they keep stealing more Palestinian lands."
