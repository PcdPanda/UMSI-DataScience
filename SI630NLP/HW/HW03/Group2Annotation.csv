t3_n26t3x	gwhl8wk	Gamer girls, what are your experiences when gaming with males?	Most males have found it refreshing that I’m there to play and have fun, not to be that girl who flirts with everyone and begs/expects to be given items for having boobs. They’re very welcoming and respectful usually. My only issue was some gender bias in WoW. I was a tank in competitive raiding guilds. I always wanted a new guild I applied to to parse my previous raids and see some video before joining the voice chat interview portion. Sadly, too many males thought I should heal and not tank simply because I have a vagina. /shrug. Showed them... Top 100 US isn’t half bad, boobs or no boobs haha!	603.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

t3_n2ad4s	gwibxp0	ELI5: how are gorillas and similar animals taught sign language?	They aren’t. At least not in the way you probably believe. Gorillas don’t compose sentences. They can be trained to repeat patterns and expect results, but they aren’t using human language in any meaningful sense. It’s similar to training your dog to bark when they want a treat. There’s a great podcast with an episode about this: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/koko-the-gorilla/id1380008439?i=1000483131905	415.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
t3_n2aoqp	gwiggxi	What is it about bottled water that makes people think it’s safer than tap water?	My local tap water tastes like dissolved chalk.

t3_n2agq3	gwitbsc	Any non-fiction writers in this sub? What is the number one tip you’d give to someone wanting to write a non-fiction book?	I had a professor once that tasked us with writing a description of a tree near our classroom and thirty or so students—including myself—all failed. In one way or another, either via personification or indulgent descriptions, the class as a whole failed the very simple and basic principle of presenting to the reader exactly what the writer/author is seeing/experiencing. My recommendation is twofold. 1. I belive nonfiction is an all-in gamble where you risk writing about something boring but present the material in a compelling and captivating way. Dont let the subject of your writing dissuade you; have confidence that your voice and attention to detail will carry your narrative. 2. Strive for a rich level of texture in your writing. Your topic, whatever it is, will have its own rich history that includes places, people and significant events that played a role in crafting its present state. Each of these should be seen as opportunities to fill in the world you are presenting to the reader so dont be afraid to stray from the main narrative to share an adjacent story that better develops the focus of your topic. To conclude I think that good writing paints a picture of reality but great writing erases the detectable brushstrokes of the written word. The more effort you put into the details the easier you make it for your readership to slip into and inhabit your story. Good luck and have fun.	1412.0	5.0	4.0	4.0
t3_n2awyq	gwibgl5	How has photography changed the world?	It's added perspective by allowing people to see things they simply couldn't perceive before. Freeze-frames of a bird's wings in flight. The motion involved in a raindrop landing. What distant galaxies look like. Also, there is at least the possibility of being able to objectively prove that someone committed a crime by producing a picture of them doing it, so trials don't have to depend on how trustworthy witnesses are nearly as much as they used to.	455.0	4.0	5.0	5.0

t3_n2bb3g	gwidna7	What is the worst case of Déjà Vu you've ever had?	this is actually classified as déjà rêvé (already dreamed) but weird either way. for some background, this last year i’ve had a bad habit of oversleeping for work, and sometimes i will anxiously dream i’ve overslept again. i was trying to be more responsible about it so i’d been making a real effort to set a ton of alarms and go to sleep at an appropiate time. on the day i had a dream i had it drilled into my head that i worked at 4 pm that day. i had a dream the morning of that shift that i had overslept for work, and when i looked at my phone in my dream, it was something like 11:20 am when i thought i had to work at 10:30. in my dream i was confused because this was wrong— i knew i worked at 4 that day. i wake up and realize it was just a dumb stress dream, right? go to work later on like normal. two days later i had a shift at 10:30 am, and as you can imagine, i literally wake up at about 11:20 am having overslept. wasn’t confused this time, but i should have heeded the dream more than i did. i understand why it would seem coincidental but i remember the time in the dream being the same time as when i really woke up late two days later. glad i still have the job tho lol	1192.0	5.0	5.0	4.0
t3_n2bjwy	gwihae3	What would you recommend for someone who is exhausted from doom scrolling and just wants to take a break but also not leave the internet?	If you're frequently doom scrolling then the problem is the content you consume. The best thing you can do is to unfollow/unsubscribe from the content that brings you down and replace it with either neutral or positive material. If it's intetesting or entertaining AND also doesn't make you feel bad, it's good to keep around. If you want to stay informed, check news sites every now and then. It's much harder to scroll through misery that way. Don't 'take a break' from doom scrolling, stop doing it entirely. Otherwise you'll just get exhausted again and again for no reason. You don't gain anything from it so don't wear yourself out.	638.0	4.0	4.0	4.0
t3_n2bkyt	gwiimhn	In what ways have you turned out more like your parents than you ever thought you'd be?	My fathers inability to say no to helping people. My dad would give until it hurt and I grew up seeing the strain that put on him. He also had a hard woman to love for a wife. All this would sometimes really burn him out and he still barely pursues his hobbies. I swore I would try and make sure I remembered take care of me more often. But I found I very rarely do what I would like to do an end up helping others a lot and having a hard time saying no. Though I think I do better self care than my dad. Or at least I hope, 2020 however was the first time I really reached a moment where I felt I could not take on another burden or I was going to collapse. Maybe its getting older or 2020 was just that tough. But it was when I realized I am basically him in this way.	770.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_n3iv62	gwq3coi	I'm deep in love with my friends girlfriend and I'm just really lost..?	You admire both of them, her in a romantic way. She knows. She has made no move to leave her boyfriend, and has not indicated that she is interested in you romantically. At this point, you need to let go of that idea. If you can actually be her friend, then great. However it sounds like you have got a little fixated on the idea of being with her. Don't let that blind you to other opportunities (that may be more realistic) for your happiness in the future. If you don't mind me being brutally honest, (I am trying to be helpful here, it is kindly meant) I suspect you of allowing yourself to be carried away by your feelings before you have engaged the feelings of the other person. That can be counter-productive. You can't be IN love with someone who doesn't love you back and as pure as unrequited love is, it is pain for very little reward. Angst for its own sake. You can do better for yourself.	903.0	5.0	4.0	4.0
t3_n3nkcg	gwqvm5k	What's your airline horror story?	I had flown from California to Vancouver and had to catch a connecting flight to Penticton to see my family. My flight at LAX was delayed half an hour which some how translated into being delayed getting to Vancouver by another I guess 30 mins or so because of boarding and we sat on the runway for 800 years. I get there and the line up to get through customs is about 20 miles long, got through surprisingly quick considering but by that time I had to get ALL THE FUCKING WAY ACROSS THE AIRPORT in 15 mins and get through another security check on that side to make my flight, there was another line....thankfully the lady at that security was very nice and let me skip ahead but I asked no less than three other people to call the gate and let them know I was here and I was hauling ass and NO ONE would help me. There wasn’t even any of those luggage cart guys to beg for help. I made it to the gate just as the gate attendant was closing the door and she did let me run out to the small plane and board but she didn’t let me through without a snotty “This is why you’re supposed to be at the airport early.” I almost cut her throat on the spot. The kicker??? My luggage got lost.	1184.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_n3lvc6	gwqwiaj	If I like Fleabag, will I like I May Destroy You?	No? Sometimes? Maybe? I think they're similar in that they both star women who are the primary creative force - the show runner. Both ladies have very strong artistic voices and sharp points of view. I May Destroy You primarily revolves around a sexual assault. It's not especially concerned with entertaining you, or making you chuckle, or leaving you feeling emotionally fulfilled. In a lot of ways, it almost feels like she (the creator/star lady, Michaela something?) is working it all out for herself, and you're just along for the ride. She's doing it for herself, and she doesn't really care what you think about it all. Anyway, if you're looking for something Fleabag-ish, I'd recommend [Insecure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecure_(TV_series)). Closer in tone to Fleabag than IMDY. But if you're up for watching a challenging story by a talented lady, give it a watch.	882.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

t3_n3p9mp	gwrj634	What song do you feel an emotional connection to and why?	I associate most of my memories and emotions with songs, but the one that most comes to mind is Chemicals by Zach Winters. One weekend, I went on a date with this girl from a speech class in college. The date went amazingly well, and I was excited to see her again. I distinctly remember sitting in the hallway the following Monday, listening to that song, and the chorus playing as I looked up and saw her walking down the hall with the sun shining on her face through the window. My heart was racing because I really liked her, and hoped she felt the same way. When we made eye contact, she broke into this huge smile and my heart stopped racing because I knew she liked me, too. It’s been nearly 4 years since I last spoke to her, but that song still makes me smile thinking of that memory.	793.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

It's just so absurd, like, why the hell would we have this dense, delicate, energy-consuming organ bobbing around on our shoulders if we never use it.

t3_n3q9mr	gwrchdb	What was your worst public bathroom experience?	During a day trip in the Moroccan atlas, stopping in a mountain village, by the only cafe on the street- only men sitting outside, lazy early afternoon. Heads turn in disapproval as we exit the car - I (F, 32ish) was at the driving wheel. Indoor at the bar, a couple more males ordering drinks and chatting, going silent as we foreigners enter. My partner (M) orders coffees, goes to sit outside at a table. I ask for the toilet, and get sent upstairs (!) to the mezzanine. It’s all men upstairs too, watching a match on tv. Heads turn, they go silent. I go for the “toilet” in a corner. This toilet, a small room (2meters long by 1m wide) on a corner of the mezzanine, could have been a wardrobe. Or a storage space. It’s small. Turkish-style toilet (hole on the floor), hadn’t been cleaned since 1980 or so. Things float in there. The smell.. sour. There is no window, no vent, but most importantly, the light doesn’t work. Men stare at me as I enter. The door doesn’t close well either! I really have to pee, so I hold close the door, as everything goes dark. I try to figure out where to place my feet, lower my trousers while still holding the door with one hand. I pee in the dark, hoping it doesn’t go on my clothing. I raise the jeans while still holding the stupid door and thinking it is still very silent. Are they listening to me? Finally open the door, regain sight, breath again, and cross eyes with a men outside who was on the stairs up to the mezzanine. Finally, I realise there’s nothing to wash my hands, press the pedal to flush (no water.. of course), I rush out of the toilet and dowstairs and outside to my table, to my wipes, my coffee and my partner who is puzzled by my shocked face. Coffee was good.	1726.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

t3_n3qr0j	gwrjpaz	Just realized i dont have many hobbies... Any advice?	I just found my hobby, it's growing and collecting mushrooms! I stumbled upon a mushroom cultivation timelapse video in youtube a while ago, seeing them grow into weird shapes from microscopic spores is amazing. So I looked for more, that's when I fell in the rabbit hole. Getting into mushrooms stuff, or mycology, is easy, although not as easy as getting a small plant, planning ahead and patience is the key to quality mushroom. The majority of mushrooms/fungi are quite suitable for indoor cultivation, they can be very low maintenance if the environment is accomodating enough. If you are fascinated by fungi's diversity and how unique some mushrooms look, and growing has been a success, then you're ready for the next level. That's harvesting, isolating, and even mixing the genes of mushrooms you find interesting. This means you can end up with a strain that grows super fast, or one that has unique colors, or one that's just big. Since the lifecycle of mushrooms are fairly short, the influence of selective cultivation can be visible in a relatively very short timeframe, when compared to animals and plants. Also I noticed you make music from the post, MycoLyco[MycoLyco](https://youtu.be/J-nIBA0V_No) from youtube uses mushroom as his instrument to play MIDI, so that's cool. Some mushrooms can be grown for food, for medicinal use or just for the view. There's quite a few awesome subreddits (such as r/mycology, r/mushroomgrowers) and youtube channels ([Philly Golden Teacher](https://youtube.com/c/PhillyGoldenTeacher), [90 Second Mycology](https://youtube.com/c/90SecondMycology)) that have a lot of information on this subject, as well as people who are more than happy to help others learn. I'm actually pretty new to this myself (hopefully I got everything right), but a few weeks of exposure and some light research really got me hooked. Hope you find the hobby you're looking for soon!	1908.0	3.0	1.0	5.0
t3_n3qtvf	gwrd561	eli5, how is Mercury the closest planet to every planet in our solar system?	"The problem is that ""closest"" is a bit too vague. If you mean the closest Planet right now at this very moment. It is Mercury. If you mean the closest Planet on average it is too Mercury. If you mean the closest Planet most for the longest time, it is mercury too. However the Planet that actually gets the closest to us is Venus. 7 Month from now Venus will be as close to us as any planet ever gets and in October last year Mars was closer than any other planet. When you ask what Planet is closest to us right now it is always Mars, Venus or Mercury with Mercury being the answer most often. It all depends on where in their orbits the planets are. If one of them is on the same side of the sun as us and the other two are on the far side of the sun, that is the closest. Mercury has the advantage that even if it is on the far side it is not that much farther away, because it orbits so close to the sun. Venus has the advantage that it gets the closest out of all of them."	977.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

We all knew this, because this one guy who had been bullying him for pretty much their entire lives went round and told us. The next day, the guy who got the boner was talking to some of the girls, and the bully kid shouted across to him ""Try to not get a hard on, I saw it last night... it was massive!"" The bully, in an effort to embarrass this kid, clearly didn't realise that he's just told a bunch of hormonal teenage girls, that the guy they're talking to has a massive dick, and also didn't realise that all of this is making him look like he spent the night staring at this kid's massive dick."	759.0	5.0	4.0	4.0
t3_n50lc8	gx2nx5o	ELI5: How is a co-dopant chosen while doping a nanoparticle? Can any pair of elements be used as co-dopants depending on the required properties?	Three factors to keep in mind are crystal structure, number of electrons, and energy levels. You usually want a dopant that doesn't change the crystal structure too much - meaning it should either be a similar size to the atom it's replacing, or be much smaller so it can sit between atoms (this is called an interstitial). Usually the dopant will have a different number of valence electrons than the atom it's replacing, and the difference determines whether it adds or removes electrons (p-type vs n-type). The energy levels of the nanoparticle (HOMO and LUMO) and the energy levels of the dopant determine the doping efficiency - which is the fraction of dopants that actually dope the material. Energy levels also determine what the nanoparticles actually do, especially if you're absorbing or releasing light.	815.0	4.0	4.0	4.0
t3_n50x5p	gwyn31o	people who have survived a natural disaster, what was it like?	I'm from FL and have lived through if I had to guess, 10 major hurricanes. Most of them spawned tornadoes or the winds of the hurricane itself were strong enough to destroy buildings on their own. The handful that came through in like 2007 (Charley, Jean or Francis maybe?) were so bad that one of them tore off the flat section of our roof that sat over my brother and I's bedrooms/the hallway and our bathroom. It didn't come all the way off tho, it fell back down like 6 inches from its original location so there was a 6 inch gap in the ceiling between the main A frame roof and the flat one over that end of the house. As in, you could look up and see the sky and our bedrooms flooded because of the rain. We lost most of our possessions to water or mold damage	766.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

In Linux systems, the first thing that happens when your computer boots is the init program runs. It's in charge of doing the rest of the startup - things like ""let you log in"". The controversy comes from the fact that systemd also does a *lot* of other things - like ""run background processes"" and ""manage network connections"". To a lot of Linux users/developers, there's a deeply-held philosophy of ""each program should do one thing and do it well"". People got upset about systems switching over to systemd completely - they wanted to be able to pick and choose. There's some connected concerns about a lot of systemd being designed/implemented by a small group of people. At this point, a lot of the controversy has died down - people have mostly settled in with the fact that systemd exists and is at least alright at what it does."	877.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_n53lrg	gx0iiou	What's my prospect after a masters in Neuroscience?	Based on what has been going on in the department I am in in big pharma, I would say a masters puts you in a strange position.

If the hiring manager thinks you are the perfect fit, they will adjust the title of the position to fit your qualifications, but I haven't seen this happen much. You can slowly work your way up. However, I think this will be less likely than it used to be just because there are so many PhDs now. My potential new manager is one such person who slowly worked their way up to research fellow. It is still not easy getting into industry with a PhD. I would recommend applying to some place like Biogen (still does a lot of neuroscience work) and see where you get.

t3_n68rbk	gx5pffa	“A person often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.” has this ever happened to you? If so, how?	This may not be exactly what you’re looking for, but this concept is important in sports psychology. You do exactly the thing you’re trying not to do all the time, because the subconscious mind (which is in charge of coordinating your movements) doesn’t understand negative instructions. “Just don’t overshoot it”, or “just don’t slice this drive,” or “just don’t kick it straight at the goalkeeper” are not thoughts the mind can turn into actions. When you think “don’t kick it to the goalkeeper” your subconscious doesn’t know what to do with that, but it does respond to the fact that you’re focusing on and visualizing kicking it to the goalkeeper. So lo and behold, that’s exactly what you do. The only productive thoughts are positive instructions; you have to think about what you want to do, never about what not to do. Visualize your penalty kick going into a specific corner of the goal, or your golf swing arcing inside-to-outside to draw instead of slicing, or visualize the cue ball rolling at the desired speed into the position zone. Thoughts about the outcomes you want to avoid will only make you more likely to achieve them.	1142.0	3.0	4.0	3.0

t3_n68022	gx5n8oz	How can I make my own circle of friends and close-ones and not chase other people's dreams?	First of all, it's amazing that you have realized that finding your own ideal social circle is a much better goal to have than aiming to become the center of the one you have randomly found yourself in. Here are a few steps you can follow to help you achieve that: 1. Stop chasing around meaningless friendships and trying to impress other people. Become absolutely certain that you are better off on your own than with a random group of people who don't care about you. 2. Start working on yourself more actively. Exercise regularly, read more than ever, chase your dream job or start a business. Explore various ways you can become the best version of yourself. 3. Slowly start meeting new people and see if you meet anyone who is a good fit for you as a friend. It's hard to know in the beginning since it takes time to get to know someone, but there is always a strong presence (or lack) of some chemistry from the start. If you are wondering how and where you can meet new people, here are a few ideas: * pick up interesting hobbies, preferably ones where you can socialize; * consider volunteering in a local community; * start going to the gym; * try out a recreation sports club; * join local clubs (book club, wine club, etc.); * explore online communities and see if you can meet interesting local people there. Also, there is an awesome blog out there which goal is to help you become the center of your social circle :)	1431.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

If I’m not actively paying close attention to it, that peanut butter lid is gonna go to that gallon of milk like a moth to a lamp. I’ve had this problem for years, it drives me crazy sometimes.

He proceeded to talk about the job for 15 minutes without asking me a single question. A co-worker comes in and adds a few details to the job, then abruptly asks, ""do you drink?"" I was at a loss, how do I answer this question - especially in light of it being the first question I am being asked! I stammered for a bit, then the co-worker says with a shit-eating grin on his face, ""Don't worry, you will!"" The hiring manager then outright asks me when I could start, and oh yeah, do I have any questions. I inquired about the pay and hours and said I would be able to start immediately.

The laboratory was in the basement. The experiments required me to sit for a long time in the basement, which was damp, dusty, dark, and subject to the continuous noise of running vacuum pumps that pretty much drowned everything else. I had to be there simply to occasionally move a knob or push a button, while trying to study or work the rest of the time, amidst the noise. One day I said, fuck that. I checked the manual of the instrument I was controlling. There was documentation for a digital interface. You had to code the instructions manually after establishing the connection, but it was possible. I found a cable to interface the local computer with the instruments I needed to control. I wrote a program that would connect to the instrument and send the required instructions at the click of a button. Then I used remote desktop functionality to access that computer from my laptop, while sitting in my office. And from then on all I had to do was go in the lab at the beginning of the day, turn the machines on, then turn them off at the end. The rest of the time I'd just monitor and control everything that was happening from my desk, three floors above, while doing something else at my laptop, in perfect, blissful silence.	1326.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

t3_n6bamo	gx62ide	"ELI5: What is our brain doing when ""Something random just occurred to me""?"	"Yes, the brain is constantly doing things our conscious mind has nothing to do with. Consciousness allows us to keep a train of thought and stay focused on a problem, but almost everything else the brain does without conscious interference. In fact, it's been demonstrated that our brains start to act before our consciousness enters into play. Your brain already decided to get this for lunch or make that for dinner before you were consciously aware of making the decision. When ""something random just occurred to you"" your brain put together information in the background of your mind and decided ""hey, you should think about this"" and presented it to your conscious mind. It's like how you might be distracted driving but your attention snaps back to the road when something iffy happens cause your peripheral senses, while you were distracted, were still paying attention and got your conscious attention as soon as the information they processed meant something was wrong. Another example is how people with certain types of blindness are able to walk around objects naturally if they're distracted. Their eyes and brain are still communicating and processing the objects around them, but the brain can't present it to the conscious part so they technically can't ""see."""	1276.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

That way she gets no attention and she won’t get that satisfying feeling of power around you. People get angry because they don’t feel heard enough so they feel the need to scream. My mom was this way. But you just need to show them that you won’t give them what they want until they talk to you like a normal human being.

t3_n6bdsb	gx6433i	I absolutely hate sharing anything. Don’t even look at my food. Why am I like this and how can I fix it?	There’s nothing wrong with wanting your things to belong with you. Having a tight grip on your stuff doesn’t necessarily make you selfish; that stems more from what you are able to give away but refuse to. Giving your time away is a good act. Sometimes giving money to someone in need. You don’t have to share your car or sandwich to be a kind person. If you see it as a possible confrontational issue with someone (maybe it already was before) then just try to ponder what the worse outcome could be if it happens. Someone taking your car could run it off the road. But if someone borrowed something like a basketball, what’s the worst that can happen. You don’t have an obligation to lend out anything of yours, but maybe stressing less about can help ease any difficulty you face. Good luck!	794.0	5.0	4.0	4.0
t3_n6bvfm	gx6mpvt	Why do most philosophers disagree with moral relativism?	&gt; It is an empirical fact that what is considered good or bad, right or wrong is relative, contingent on contexts whether they are cultural, social, temporal or situational etc. When we say this, though, we should be careful about what we cash out as being relative to what. For instance, as per your example, are there many cultures (as a matter of empirical fact) believe that the best actions (morally speaking) are the ones which cause the most suffering? Are there many cultures which believe that right actions are the ones which are done for reasons which contain logical contradictions? Are there many cultures which believe that cowardice, dishonesty, and vanity are admirable traits? That is, when we talk about this relativity, are we talking about the apparent diversity of how specific material practices are evaluated or are we talking about the diversity of the evaluative criteria?	900.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_n7ge3k	gxgly7r	What is your most unexplainable/creepy/paranormal experience that still makes your skin crawl?	"At the time this happened I was about 16 years old, and my sister about 14. We went camping, it was all quite fun, until it got dark. For dinner we prepared salad and grilled meat, but once we finished, my father and I took care of ordering some things while my sister went to wash the dishes. About 5 minutes passed and my sister came back, trembling and completely pale, and asked me to please accompany her, because she did not feel safe in the sink (I must add that there was a common sink where everyone went to wash dirty things, so it was a bit far from where we were camping. Not too far, but a bit). After telling her not to be so scared, I decided to accompany her because she didn't wanted to go alone. As we approached the sink it was completely dark, so I had to approach with a flashlight. As I got closer I saw that there were spiders on the sink, at that moment I turned to laugh, thinking that it was the spiders that had scared my sister. I approached again and when I was about to crush one of the spiders, a shadow of what seemed about 2 meters passed extremely fast behind the sink, hiding behind (and I say that it was very fast, at a speed impossible for a normal human). Obviously I was scared and I approached with the flashlight to check what that had been, but there was nothing. I turned around to see if my sister had also seen what I had, and I only saw her again pale, trembling and with wide eyes. I looked again in the direction of the sink to now realize that the figure was now about 5 meters from where we were, totally still. It looked like the figure of a normal person, except that it was very tall and was completely dark (although I pointed the flashlight at it). We both looked at each other, saying with our eyes: ""We must get out of here quickly."" Just at that moment the figure began to move towards us, so we instantly ran out of there. We went back to our dad and we told him everything, he got angry with us and went to wash by himself, and when he came back he told us that he did not know what we were talking about, and that he had not seen anything in the sink. At the time of writing this I asked my sister if she could remember all this, and she just looked at me with wide eyes and left the room without saying a single word to me.

t3_n7ge69	gxd703o	"How would Marx and other prominent Communist philosophers react to ""people seeking out communism to expand their privilege"" and is luxary inherently against communist goals ?"	Moishe Postone posits in his book Time, Labor, and Social Domination that orthodox Marxists had the trouble of reaffirming the superficial Marxian understanding of labor as a trans-historical category guiding social development. He says that this is mistaken, as the method of Marxism (immanent dialectical critique) expresses categories of social analysis only as far as they are aligned with the current historical period: when we consider that socialism is an expansion and improvement upon capitalist productivity and industrialism by way of social planning, we forget that what Marx was ultimately critiquing is the status of *labor* in capitalist society, which is growing increasingly anachronistic to society as the productivity and processes of social reproduction become defined by things increasingly removed from labor. All of this is to say that post-capitalism should be defined not only by a transformation of the capabilities of production, but also as a wide transformation of work and labor. Labor under socialism (which I use interchangeably with communism) is much more enriching to individuals. So, communism ultimately implies a society more in line with the will of people and their desire unimpeded by the capitalist production process. There isn’t a class of people who “benefit” the most from socialism because socialism has no classes. As for your point against anarchism...anarchism’s anti civilization tendencies are widely discredited and seen as foolish by Marxists...read J.J. Rousseau!	1518.0	5.0	4.0	5.0
t3_n7g2z9	gxcooaa	ELI5 - How does a Boomerang work?	http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html I’m going to try my best to interpret here: basically a boomerang is built to have an aerofoil (wing) always at the top edge of the object. An aerofoil causes air to move faster around it, which creates lift. What this accomplishes is that the boomerang is pushed to the left (most boomerangs I’ve seen are left-rotating) from whatever direction it is parallel to. If you get enough spin that that aerofoil turns through enough air to push it just at the right rate and right amount, you can get it to come right back to you. Otherwise it whizzes past you and you duck anyways. This is my basic understanding. I may be wrong, at parts, but I know for a fact that the boomerang is shaped like a plane’s wing, and instead of getting lift upwards it gets most of the lift normal to the boomerang as torque.	856.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

This might be a stretch: much of the security on the internet is based on encryption, which is built around creating a math problem that has an answer, but is unsolvable without resorting to trying every single possible option. Systems like this include [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) and [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)). There is a huge body of mathematicians and computer scientists studying this subject, but nobody has been able to figure out an easy way to solve either problem. In fact, all our security is based on nobody being able to.	613.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
t3_n7htv9	gxcwumb	What movie does everyone love that you think aged horribly?	"The original _Star Wars_ isn't actually all that elegant of a production, and without the music and special effects it would be very weak as a drama (in fact Alec Guinness, who had starred in many classic films before becoming Obi-Wan, thought it was drivel), and relatively dull as an adventure. _Star Wars_ excelled because no one had ever done a picture like that before. It was viscerally exciting and mind-blowing, but only to people who'd never experienced anything like it. Other movies, shows, and games have since done a better job, and to modern audiences the original _Star Wars_, while undeniably a couple of hours well-spent, wouldn't make the same meteoric impact. That's perhaps a stretch to characterize as ""aged horribly,"" but certainly I think the film has fallen a great ways from its original height. It was very much a product of its time, and lightning in a bottle."	887.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

t3_n7ide1	gxd03bp	ELI5: how are pop songs with single artists made?	I'm not an expert in this but I had to learn about it in a music class a while ago. Basically a LOT of it depends on the artist. There are ghost writers and other people that will write songs and sell them off to an artist or record company in which case the artist is usually just doing vocals/playing an instrument. However there is a bit of controversy about doing that kind of thing in some communities and instead musical artists are often expected to do everything on their own with maybe some help from a producer. If they have help from a producer then the artist is usually the one singing/playing an instrument while a producer would go in and put it all together, mix it, and/or add in some more beats. Overall, it really just depends on the artist and even their contract with a music record (if they have one) as they can also have some influence over what an artist creates.	888.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_n8pg87	gxjty1o	What’s an advice everyone should know if they’re battling with anxiety?	my therapist put it really nicely to me one time where he said anxiety is like a fire alarm for your body , it alerts you that you aren't feeling 100% , its in those moments where we have to examine and dig deep into our issues and figure out what is causing our anxieties , work , family , relationships , being in your head , overthinking etc in those moments it can be hard to ground yourself but if you can take a step back and try to stay present for a few minutes you can feel the anxiety start to decrease. DBT therapy taught me some skills on grounding yourself and keeping yourself mindful . when you're anxious , find something in front of you that has words on it and read the words out loud and then start to read the letters backwards one by one for example , the dog walks in the park you would go k r a p e h t etc. grab an object like an orange and pretend you never saw an orange before and examine it how does it feel how does it smell how does it taste how does it look visualization can work too I like to imagine im sitting near a river and the river is flowing and moving a million miles an hour and im sitting on the grass and I can feel the grass beneath me tickling my body , I run my hands through the grass and its soft and I want to take out the knots in the grass and make it smooth, I watch the river run and imagine my thoughts are apart of the river , I might think of a bad breakup , ill see him and our fights and acknowledge that it happened and like the river flows , ill let it flow with the river and out of my head.	1554.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_n8q1k7	gxm84p5	"Eli5 How tf do scientists know the ""maps"" of million years old continents?"	There are a couple of things to consider. We know which way the continents are currently moving (and how fast) so we can basically reverse the movement we see to show where they previously were. This also couples with the shapes of the continents - when the shapes broadly correspond it is a good sign that that is how they were previously joined. We can also be a bit more scientific and compare the rock formations we see - our maps show roughly which bits were attached to which bits, and we can quite easily investigate the rock types and formations found at these points to see how they compare. Where they match closely it is a good hint that they were once part of the same landmass and split. You can also do the same with things like fossils - the same as nowadays, certain species lived in certain areas, so matching fossil types at opposite sides of the ocean are another marker to show they were connected.	918.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

My mom always said weird words in Spanish so I always thought the words she used to curse was old spanish slang or something. Fast forward when I was in college, I took German and on the last day of my first quarter our teacher gave us a lesson on German swear words. I come to find out that 'scheiße"" is shit in German. So every time she would need to say ""shit"" my mom just used a german curse word. When i had this revelation my whole childhood perspective changed. I called my mom to ask her if she knew, thinking that she may unsuspectingly be cursing in a language she didnt know. Turns out a old colleague of hers who spoke German taught her the word a long time ago and she used it so she could curse without ""tainting"" us.

t3_n8s2mp	gxk70re	ELI5: How are electrical devices onboard the ISS grounded?	Lots of eli12 in this thread. I'll take a stab at lowering that to 5 'grounding' is basically needed to ensure that everything is at the same 'electrical level' (voltage).The hazard of not grounding something is that if the electrical level (voltage) is different in one place compared to another and you touch both, it becomes level by going through you (not good). So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe. This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly. If their co-worker JUMPS onto the ground and is never the bridge between the two levels (voltages) at the same time, they will be safe. The important thing isn't dirt, it's that everything is the same 'level' of electrified.	1063.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_na0e43	gxqsbc4	ELI5: How do chip companies disable specific parts of a CPU or GPU to create different SKUs?	"It depends [Clock gating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_gating) is a common method, you basically flip a transistor so that it blocks the clock signal going to a portion of the chip, this prevents the chip from sending data in or out of that section. This is done in the microcode on the chip and if you have 10 blocks and need to disable 2 this lets you disable 1&amp;2 or 3&amp;7 or any combination you need to and the chip will steer traffic around that For defects that might be more problematic for the chip if physically left in, sometimes a portion of the chip is physically lasered out to physically remove the connections between the damaged portion and the rest of the chip. The microcode will then be told to ignore these portions just as above with clock gating so it can steer traffic accordingly. Lasering is a much more permanent solution while the microcode disabling can sometimes be bypassed which was fairly common about a decade ago with AMD's Phenom II dual and triple core chips which could sometimes be ""unlocked"" into quad core chips."	1064.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_na0qwv	gxquqwl	ELI5: How does 3D printing work?	"There are several different 3D printing technologies, and they all work a little different. That said, the most common one in consumer grade printers is fused deposition modeling (or FDM). In this particular technology a plastic ""wire"", called filament, is fed through a nozzle just barely hot enough to melt it, which causes it to stick to the surface under the nozzle. The nozzle is moved via computer generated commands in a pattern that builds up the 3D shape one layer at a time. The second most common is stereolithography (SLA). In this technology the printing medium is a UV reactive liquid (called resin) which hardens when exposed to light. A screen at the bottom of the printer lights up the resin at the correct points to harden it as the build plate slowly pulls it out of the tank. This technology is capable of MUCH higher detail than FDM printing, but the resin is messy and toxic, requiring the use of rubber gloves and significant post processing to make the prints safe to handle. I believe the resin is also expensive compared to FDM filament, but I can't say for certain on that because I don't have a resin printer (my house is not well ventilated and my cats are stupid enough to try to drink the resin)."	1227.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

Super busy, travelling here and there, meeting tons of people. We went separate ways and, after 5-6 years, he called me for a one-shot project. We met with other participants, doing small talk and suddenly: ""Hey, Flax, isn't your birthday today?"" It was Now, I am super introvert, so I make sure the date does not appear anywhere.

I was hired as a fu time line chef right out of high school with no experience. Well promoted really. I was a dishwasher for one of my favorite local restaurants and I was always early so they offered me a promotion after they expanded it. After about a year I just couldn’t take it. Just not my cup of tea. Now I own and run a growing cellphone repair shop.	448.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

I eventually got it covered up with a slice of pizza with the words ""whatever forever"" around it. As time went on people started telling me that I shouldn't have covered up the daddy tattoo because it was funny as hell and iconic.

t3_na2izh	gxrfeqs	What are some websites every writer should know about?	[SSA's popular baby names site](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/index.html). Absolutely invaluable when it comes to naming characters, particularly if your story is set in a certain place/time. You can look at popular names by decade and state too. [BehindtheName's Surnames Site](https://surnames.behindthename.com/) You can find surnames by ethnicity &amp; look at the most common surnames in a few countries. Google Maps, particularly Street View, is also invaluable. A portion of my current WIP is set in a small town in Louisiana, and I was able to describe it accurately based off Street View. (Turns out my husband actually has been there at least a few times, so he could verify that I got it right.) It's a pet peeve of mine as a reader when authors set a book in a certain city and screw the geography up; Jacquelyn Mitchard did this with my hometown in *The Most Wanted* &amp; I'm still salty about it 20+ years later.

t3_nb7d6q	gxy454l	People who are confident about their looks : How?	Every time someone I care about expresses something they're insecure about, it always catches me off guard. Whatever they're worried about I can't see. So it stands to reason that whatever I'm worried about when I look in the mirror is just as invisible to the people who care about me. My best always likes to comment on my looks. They're asexual so there is something deeper and more wholesome about it than if someone were flirting. Like it's not just my body they're seeing, they're seeing me. As for the people who come after my looks? If someone is that shallow, why should I care what they say? I know emotions don't listen to reason, so it's not always foolproof. Words can cut deep. But I promise you are beautiful to someone, probably many someones. And I think you should value their opinion above the evil little voice in the back of your head. We all have it, yet we all want to look like someone else. You ask me? Sounds like that little voice is full of sh&amp;\*.	979.0	5.0	4.0	4.0
t3_nb683t	gxzfeto	How do I find purpose?	Hey OP. First, I can fully relate and understand what you are going thru. It is not fun in any respect. The fact that you have reached out is an enormous and commendable step forward. Second, I’ve had to take anti-depressants as well. I honestly hated it. Made me feel blank and I walked around mostly confused. I chose to stop taking the meds. I chose to focus on daily exercise, drink 1 gallon of water a day and try to eat small portions of “healthy” food across the day. I purposed in my mind to see success as being the completion of a small step. When I walked around the block...might not be much, but it was exercise and I completed it. This a success. I believe it is ok to not know what interests you. I’m 51 and am still exploring things to discover what is out there. I have found enjoyment in the journey of exploration all by itself independent of whether what I discover “captures my attention” or not. Look. Please feel free to DM me. I hope my 2 cents has helped in even a small manner. ~ Ghozt 👻	1013.0	5.0	5.0	4.0
t3_nb7qx5	gxxvisb	ELI5: why do we say “uhm” when we’re thinking? I’m multilingual and it seems to apply to most languages. What makes it so “universal”?	Uhm and similar sounds are [filler words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_\(linguistics\)). Their main purpose is to signal that the speaker isn't done speaking. Often times we need a half second to think of what we want to say next. If we let that moment fill with silence, others may take that as a sign we are done talking and then start with their own thread. Filler words serve the purpose of signifying we have more to say. This is a universal problem. It is not surprising other languages have come up with their own filler words. Eliminating filler words from important speeches has the benefit of making the speaker sound more worth listening to. Someone who is used to being worth listening to wouldn't be worried about others interrupting their speech with their own. So we naturally give more weight to those who don't use filler words. In day to day conversations between friends though, filler words serve an important function.	947.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

t3_nb8nwn	gxyk1oe	How do I explain periods to my younger sister?	12 seems more than old enough to know about pretty much everything. If she’s asking, then just tell her. Yeah it can be a bit awkward but it so much better to be well informed. She clearly knows your mum hasn’t told her everything, otherwise she wouldn’t have come to you. It’s better she learns from a reliable source then random crap she could come across online, or like you say, misinformed friends. Check a book out of the library or find a GOOD website with correct information. Both from a science and biology standpoint and an emotional and social view. There’s so much more to sex than just the biology of it and I think it’s overlooked. Tbh your mum sounds relieved that she doesn’t have to be the one to do it anymore. My daughter is 9 and already knows almost everything. I started my periods when I was around 9/10 so I wanted to make sure she’s prepared and knew what was going to happen to her and why.	917.0	5.0	5.0	4.0
t3_nb8qov	gxy9k4e	Why are some people likable even when they don’t try to be?	It's a trait called charisma. Which is how fast you can build rapport with another person. Being charismatic is difficult and requires practice, learning, and constant improvement. Highly charismatic people aren't usually too dumb. But some people will get lucky and pick up charismatic traits unintentionally. These people make friends easily, but their charisma fades if they are not practicing and improving. It's pretty much just being able to quickly observe another person and respond in a manner that they would like most. This consists of emotional control, self awareness, laughing at others' jokes, and making jokes, being friendly without being disingenuous, finding common ground, being inquisitive or helpful at appropriate times, picking interesting topics of conversation, keeping good conversation rythm, and so on. These are all things that you can improve or get worse at depending on the type of person you want to be. Being likable and being someone whom others gravitate towards is a learned artform. Whether you start off at a low level or not, it is as possible to learn and improve as it is to deteriorate and worsen.	1141.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_nb93ff	gxy2zoo	What's a situation you noped out of?	"I can think of two... both while I was stationed in the military in Turkey. 1) Rumors were swirling that the shop branch chief had been part of a ""swingers club"" when he had been stationed in Germany. I was married at the time and my wife was quite pretty. Whenever the shop got together for family get-togethers, the branch chief and his wife would hover around me and my wife. A group of us took a trip to a resort on the mediterranian and wound up doing some night swimming. The branch chief and his wife kept drifting over towards me and my wife. We kept swimming away. Yeah, he basically had targeted my wife to try and frick. We noped out of that! 2) I arrived at the shop before my wife arrived. In the 3 month time before she arrived, I would go to the base's club drinking. I met a young couple (he was active duty and his wife). She kept inviting me over to their house to drink and was constantly dropping sexual comments. I got the hint; they were wanting a third for a menage a trois. I noped out of that. Funny thing... my wife arrived... and the same girl came over while my wife and I were out eating. After she found out I was with my wife, she never approached me again."	1188.0	5.0	5.0	5.0

t3_nbahzi	gxyb42p	If a person has a tendency to be very empathetic toward people who do bad things, not condoning the actions but not wanting them to face consequences either, how much should they worry that they themselves are becoming bad people?	Not at all, but if anything you're at risk of becoming an enabler and falling into a pattern of making excuses for people who are really harming or taking advantage of you even if it doesn't seem like they're doing it on purpose. It's really important to set some concrete boundaries on what behaviors you will and won't tolerate and how you want to be treated, otherwise people will use you and manipulate you because you're empathetic and kind. It's also paramount to recognize that you are doing that person a disservice by not allowing them to learn from the consequences of their actions, thus hurting their growth. It may be painful, but some people just need to learn the hard way. I'm speaking from strong personal experience here and I wish I could make a better judgement on character and behavior and not totally on personality.	839.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_nbakbg	gxybmwr	Can you have more than one agent?	So, there are situations where people have more than one agent (at the same time). Off the top of my head, a couple of examples would be: –when you're branched out into new genres/categories the original agent does not rep/does not wish to rep. –your agent is in the UK/US but does not work with co-agents in the US/UK, so you get a seperate agent on the opposite side of the pond. But from what you've said, this doesn't apply to you. It sounds like you have a case of 'the grass is greener'. You have an agent, they've sold (or are shopping) your work (so those manuscripts remain with them), but now you want an additional agent for new work.... am I getting the gist right? In this scenario, you are unlikely to be able to have 2 agents. After all, your agent gets a cut of what they sell, so how would that work with 2 agents? Are you planning to cut your original agent out of new deals? Because, why would they be okay with that? Likewise, why would the new agent want a second voice in the mix? Are you even willing to give them both 15% a piece? So essentially, you have to choose: stay with your original agent, or allow yourself to get poached (it sounds like new agent approached you?) and hope it goes every bit as well as you expect it to and that the new doors open. The fact is, writers change agents all the time. Yes, in a perfect world, the first agent you land with is your perfect fit and you both enjoy a career long partnership. In the real world, this rarely happens. But it's a gamble to move agents when everything is going well - so the real question is: what makes you think new agent is going to open more doors?	1641.0	5.0	5.0	4.0
t3_nbarqd	gxyb91d	I want someone like you, but not you. What did you mean when you said this to someone?	"For me it usually means that I do like them but there's only one detail that's preventing me from just asking that girl out. Usually it's like knowing that she lives too far away from me for it to be realistic, or she has 3 cats and im allergic to cats. Or maybe we've been friends for years and I wouldn't dare ruin that friendship. Usually that line means ""I really like you, but one detail is keeping me from giving in to my desire"" For me that's what it means anyway."	471.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

And I drew my Gerber Strongarm from its horizontal configuration on my belt and lunged at my attacker. He jumped back swiftly, avoiding my strike and I quickly lunged again, slicing the left side of his torso. I guess he figured out my pattern and when I went for a third thrust, he used a cowardly trip and I fell to the ground. He set upon me, ganking my keys, wallet and phone. In a final at of cowardice he stabbed me with my own knife two inches to the right of my navel. I jammed my thumb into the wound to prevent my lung from collapsing and rose to my feet.

It has some great characters, scary moments, and some humor. Ending is a bit, well... it's a King ending, so you know what you're signing up for.

She had 3 beds (because she had different favourite sleeping spots depending on the time of day and where the sun was), blankets, litter trays, liners, enormous bags of litter, a water fountain etc. It took me a while to feel up to laundering all her beds, blankets and cushions. I've donated the items in good condition to the local shelter, together with all the unused cat food I had stocked.

A lot of jobs in publishing go to people who have certificates from colleges in publishing programs. It's a really, really tough industry to crack in any meaningful way. My editors (all with bigger publishers) toiled a long time in poorly, or unpaid, internship positions for years before slowly climbing up. There are just vastly more qualified applicants than there are positions, and those positions themselves always seem to be shrinking. As such, 'pivoting' from an outside industry into publishing, at least on the editorial side, is not going to be easy, since there are people who have been trying to crack it directly for a very long time - probably longer than you (and while you've been in a different industry). I don't mean to dissuade you. People say the same thing about writers who make a living publishing books, and yet - people do it all the time! Just because it's tough, doesn't mean you can't do it! One thing to consider might be where you live. If it's not NYC, there are going to be fewer jobs. I actually interned at a literary agency while working on a dissertation. I just emailed the place, met with an agent who needed an agent, and read manuscripts for her. Being a volunteer reader while keeping your current gig might be a good way to get in somewhere!	1285.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

I switched majors in junior year of college and got a Communications degree not knowing at all what I wanted to do, and then landed a shitty job after graduation selling classified ads in the paper because I needed to eat. Well, from selling ads in the paper I went to selling ad tech software, realized I just hated sales, and internally transitioned to an Account Services role.

t3_ndtdu9	gyci449	ELI5: Is there a reason we have 2 nostrils?	Short answer - This gives us a better range of smell. Long answer - 2 nostrils effectively act like two noses. Due to some biological mechanics, usually one nostril allows less air to pass through than the other, with the nasal flow switching every few hours. The sensory cells in our nose sometimes require more time to identify certain odors, and a low-airflow nostril gives them more time to be detected, giving us a better ability to detect scents.

Instead, he flips over onto his hands and knees and starts staring at something right off the edge of the bed on his side. I'm like wtf so I look where he's looking and at first I can't see anything, but as my eyes adjusted I started to see a face. I initially thought it was a person with a weapon and that's why my fiance stopped struggling and didn't answer me, but the more my eyes adjusted the more I realized it was just a hovering head. It wasn't normal looking, tho. It was more like a hologram of a head, like there was no color to it. Just lighting and shading. Almost like if you could mold smoke into the shape of a human head. I'd remember the guy's face if I ever saw him in person, too. He had a long thin face, high prominent cheek bones, kind of almond shaped slanted eyes and he had long hair pulled back by a bandana or head scarf or something. My fiance was the first to lay back down, but I kept looking at it waiting for it to move. It never did and eventually I couldn't stand to see it anymore and hid my face.

t3_ndtpg3	gycnfhv	How do you make your characters sound different from one another?	When I'm planning everything out, I think of a few people or characters that I'd like each of my own characters to resemble. For example, a female mentor with a storied past could be based partly on Jasnah Kholin (Stormlight) and Camina Drummer (The Expanse). I can imagine how either of those characters would speak, so I ask myself what they would say in this situation, and how they would say it - clipped, direct, and seeing straight through everyone's bs. Eventually, I get a good feel for how my own characters would react, but these comparisons help me keep them in the personalities and speech patterns that I originally envisioned. If this is an area you really struggle with, it might be better to fix dialogue after you've finished the story, so you can focus solely on that. You could pull out everyone's lines and look at each character's path individually, to check consistency. I find that doing a shitty job on something and then fixing it is easier than trying to do it perfectly the first time.	1012.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

My best friend was ftm and came out to me, and that made me start to question what I was. I started to research a bit and I felt that I fit mostly with “not female and not masculine.” But I got confused with my breast dysphoria. I started binding and I thought maybe that meant that I wanted to be a man. I started dressing more masculine, but the more I did, I kept fluctuating from women’s and men’s clothes. I wore make up occasionally, and now I don’t really care for makeup much, I just don’t really like it. But overtime I started realizing that that I was only feeling dysphoria about my breasts and my build, not my genitalia. I also came to a decision then that I didn’t want to be a man because even if I did, the image of myself that I wanted would never match up with that of what my body could actually look like and handle. So I went back to identifying as a woman, and that was awful too.	1008.0	3.0	1.0	3.0

Move the first three episodes, the ones that dealt with the Night King, in season 7 thus making it a 10 episode season and conclude that season with the defeat of the Others. Then have 10 episodes for season 8 that deal strictly with Daenerys' final conquest and her evolution from heartbreak and grief to cruelty.	502.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

We started heading back there and their Border Collie came flying out of nowhere. We tried to run but obviously he was faster than us and he got my brother. I wasn't about to fight a dog that was as big as me at that point so I hopped on my bike and left him behind to get our dad. In hindsight, we knew about the highly aggressive dog they had but since we grew up with our mom training, showing and breeding GSDs we weren't afraid of dogs and we assumed everyone could control them as well as our mom controlled hers. But also the woman could have been like ""let me go with you"" or ""I'll go get her"" since she obviously was aware they have an aggressive farm dog.

t3_nduemy	gydx9sa	Eli5 What is the difference between a contusion (bruise) and an ecchymosis?	They are not quite interchangeable. Ecchymosis is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath, usually from a bruise but not always. Specifically it refers to the skin discoloration not the underlying cause. A contusion is when an injured blood vessel or capillaries leak blood into the surrounding tissue. This is the underlying condition, not the surface appearance. So you see ecchymosis to diagnose a contusion, but they are not the same thing.	465.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_ndvlnj	gycy5pm	How would I go about redoing my bachelors?	"Look for post-baccalaureate programs. You don't need to re-do an entire degree or do an entirely new undergrad. Pick a school that allows you to only take the courses that are required for the BA/BS in the new field you want to study, then only do those courses. Trust me, the more recent your good GPA and distant your old GPA will make a huge difference. Also, make sure to network with possible mentors to get onto undergrad research projects--these contacts will help you get into a graduate program and the newer, better GPA will be weighted much more than an older, worse GPA. When applying to graduate schools, your letter on intent can include 1-2 sentences about the low GPA (you don't have to go into specifics) and how you have turned things around and done super awesome since then by applying yourself and learning from past missteps. One other suggestion--try to take a few graduate courses while still doing undergrad (there may be some split courses--where both grad and undergrad students are split-listed in the class). This will prove that you can succeed in graduate-level courses. I did a post-baccalaureate in a STEM field, followed my own advice above and didn't even finish the post-bacc before getting admitted to the masters program in the same department. Most post-baccs take 12-24 months, but depends on how many core/prereq classes you need for the new degree. You graduate admission will weight the most recent GPA, but you will have to provide all college/university degrees in the application. Most state colleges and universities will enroll you as a ""Second BA/BS"" and others may refer to you as a post-bacc. I preferred referring to myself as a post-bacc. I spent 2 years taking more math, more chem and physics, on top of the major required courses. Then transitioned to the master's, taking graduate courses that transferred into my master's in the last half of my second year. All courses were FAFSA funded until the university/program started fully funding me with teaching and research assistantships that covered all enrollment costs and paid me a stipend."	2098.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

t3_nf368t	gyk3yb1	how do you do show don't tell?	"I've collected a few videos [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nyxelestia/wiki/screentopen#wiki_showing_over_telling) about this. I'd especially recommend [Rogue One vs. The Force Awakens — The Fault in Our Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsIQa7sH5_Y); despite being movies with no narrators, one of them still has a lot of ""telling"" about the main characters vs the other one ""showing"" us the main character. This comparison of two movies within the same franchise and time period is a good cinematic introduction to the concept of what ""showing"" and ""telling"" are. If you've got an Amazon account, I'd also recommend Sandra Gerth's ""Show, Don't Tell"", which is a free eBook on the Kindle app. Because it's free, it a little broad and barebones, but that also makes it a really good introduction to the concept and how one can work on their biggest ""telling"" weaknesses. Caveat: younger or newer writers tend to take guidelines, analysis, and suggestions as writing *rules* - ""X is bad and overdone, so don't ever do it and if you use it, your writing is bad"". As you do more research, it's easy to fall into the trap of ""I must never do this thing/use this word/write this structure"", but whatever it is, I guarantee you'll find popular contemporary authors and classics which do use it. These are exactly what I called them: guidelines (to give you a sense of direction whenever you feel lost about your writing), analysis (to help you figure out your strengths and weaknesses, lean into the former, and overcome the latter), and suggestions (ideas for what you can try if you can't think of anything on your own)."	1625.0	5.0	3.0	5.0

t3_nf8h4p	gyl0mig	What are the bounds of self-overcoming in power relationships?	"I think you are posing some excellent questions. By which I mean, you are posing questions that indicate a high level of interpretive engagement with the text. Since there is so much going on here, and because my preference is to make brief comments, I'm going to focus on just one of the questions you raise here - the first one (the main one?) regarding ""is it self-overcoming to deny one's own will to enact themselves if it in turn means holding to a higher principle they've established for themselves (etc)."" Of course, I understand this question as an elucidation of the concerns articulated in your entire second paragraph. What strikes me about this tenor of questioning is that it seems to take the Nietzschean will (or ""self,"" or ""soul"") to be something that could be (""in principle"" as it were) definitively established. As if we could know what it meant to ""enact the will."" Then, once the domain of the will has been definitively established, we can contrast it usefully with whatever concerns do not reside within the domain of the will (let's say, concern relating to some extraneous moral law or ideology) and introduce the worry that we aren't acting within the proper domain like good Nietzscheans. Probably you already have a sense of how this way of conceptualizing matters is problematic. The will is \_not\_, to begin with, a unified, given thing with an identifiable goal that we can seek to actualize. If only it were this would obviate all the difficult work that Nietzsche thinks we have ahead of us. A silly analogy. I'm reading an interesting book when it dawns on me that I'm getting hungry. And in that moment I find myself with two irreconcilable drives: a drive to continue reading and a drive to put the book down and make something to eat. It seems clear that, at least temporarily, one of these drives is going to have to be subsumed to the other. Perhaps the answer lies in one drive brutishly overpowering the other ""in the heat of the moment."" Perhaps the answer lies in appealing to a ""higher"" drive (a drive for ""reason,"" say) to adjudicate the matter on behalf of both. So, to extend the analogy I suspect that at least some of your questions could be more usefully conceptualized as attempts to reconcile conflicting aspects of the will, rather than as the pitting of the will (as if it were something already unified) against something else. Self-overcoming is precisely this process of continuous re-integration of conflicting drives. It is substantively *introspective* work that is not related that much to the external environment or whatever except insofar as that environment place us in certain circumstances. Re-read the preface to On the Genealogy of Morals. Nietzsche talks a lot there about the importance of striving for a kind of structural integrity (which straightforwardly suggests that this integrity does not really exist in the self except as an ideal we strive toward). Lastly, I will try to anticipate a possible criticism. It may sound like I'm saying ""hey there is nothing wrong with being an unreflective consumer/capitalist - that's just one aspect of your will LOL."" But the essential thing here for proper self-overcoming is that there is a (legit) striving for unity going on. If there is no striving for unity, no attempt to adjudicate conflicts in the light of some higher purpose, if it's just one drive overpowering another in a way that is left to happenstance then there is no self-overcoming going on. There is, in fact, scarcely a self worth acknowledging in such a picture."	3554.0	4.0	4.0	4.0
t3_nf8h62	gyl4f4a	ELI5: Do plants have unique DNA like humans? For example, if there were two gardenia bushes and a flower fell to the ground, could it be determined which one it came from like genetic testing etc on humans?	"You have a unique set of DNA from other humans and the same concept applies to plants even of the same subspecies. However, there are exceptions to this with plants. Consider this: If you had a skin graft taken to regrow your ear, your DNA would match a sample taken from that graft as you are its original source. Unless you had another graft taken, no other skin graft would contain your DNA, even if they appear very similar. The same applies to plant ""cuttings"", the original plants all have slightly different DNA but the cuttings themselves would have the same DNA as their ""host"" plants or parent plants. It's almost a form of cloning, the DNA (cutting X) is identical to that of the original source (plant X) but a cutting (cutting Y) from another plant (plant Y) of the same subspecies would have slightly different DNA than cutting X or plant X. So, yes and no, it depends (as seen above)"	898.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

It doesn't matter what the opinion is as long as you can back it up with some evidence and articulate it well. For the multiple choice a lot of the supreme court cases do come up and it's hard to say which ones. Also keep in mind the general stuff like time management. I forget the details but if you have 2 hours to answer 100 multiple choice questions, 1 hour in you should be at or past question 50 so keep a general eye on that ever 15 minutes or so so you can at least look at and attempt all of them. Don't spend a while thinking about something you have no idea about just guess and make a note to go back later if you can. If it helps I didn't find it the most challenging AP exam although that definitely varies by the person, but if you know your stuff and ideally if you have a general background in politics meaning you're politically aware, you should be in great shape. I remember getting to the essay portion and the first question was something super generic like what is a democracy vs a republic lol.

t3_nf9ej4	gyk98u0	ELI5: Why can't single-use plastics just be mixed together, melted down, and used to make any other plastic products?	Firstly plastic is not all a single chemical. There are thousands of different chemicals which can all be described as plastic. They all have different properties and do not work well when mixed together. It is hard to sort plastic as well since while they have different properties these are not easy to distinguish. There are some expensive big robots which use a number of different techniques to sort plastics but these are not common as they can be quite expensive investments. Another huge problem with sorting plastic is that most single use plastic products are composed of multiple different types of plastic and even other materials. It is very hard to seperate these materials from each other to sort them individually. Just imagine a plastic bottle which have a different type of platic for its cap and then the label is made up of yet another type of plastic with a forth type of plastic used for the printing on the label. And then yet another material is used to glue the label onto the bottle. That makes it almost impossible to recycle the bottle. And it is not just different types of plastic but you see a lot of packages combining metal foil, plastic and paper to get the properties they want. And you do not want metal foil or paper in your plastic that you want to recycle. You might just bearly accept the color pigments that is in the plastic as it is. And then another issue is that some plastics can not actually be melted down and recycled. Their melting temperature is higher then their self-combustion temperature. So even if you put it in a vaccuum and heat it up you will just end up with charcoal instead of molten plastic. The way these plastic products are made in the first place is through chemical reactions for exapmple by mixing two compounts together which will harden into plastic or by heating up a compound, sumbiting it to UV radiation or just give it a nucleation point. Even those plastics that can be remelted will often degrade a bit every time you do this so recycled plastic have a worse quality then freshly made plastic.	2072.0	5.0	4.0	4.0

For the really rich high income the extra taxes far outweigh what the tiny monthly check they get. But it doesn't stop there. Because if people's basic needs are met they will be less willing to engage in shit jobs, wages for the lowest paying jobs will rise. This will trickle up to the ones with better paying jobs. (we are seeing some of that right now.) There is also the fact that the economy as a whole will grow. Poor people spend money. A rich guy will not spend all his monthly income. There will be savings and investments and other stuff. A poor person will rarely have money left over at the end of the month. By redistributing money from the rich to the poor you will put more money into the hands of people who by and large will immediately spend it on stuff. This creates demand and puts money more directly into the economy than investing in stocks or an account in panama would. Of course some special products will increase in price. anything where supply is inelastic but demand will rise if more people have a few dollars more in hand. This is not a whole lot. Almost anything with truly inelastic supply is already quite expensive. The one thing that is cheap and where you can't create more of it easily is labor. Labor cost for the lowest paid jobs will rise, but that is a feature not a bug.	1656.0	5.0	2.0	4.0

The temptation to take the offer is there, but i feel the best chance for “survival” (at least, your sanity) is to live small, live quietly, and do your damned best to never raise suspicion. We have all heard of the crazy accusations made by churches and how they persecuted people based off false claims, imagine what they would do to an actual immortal?

All events of the game are canon, but not necessarily in the exact ways that you do them. While the Hero of Kvatch may have become the Grey Fox, Listener, Archmage, etc. in your playthrough, that doesn't necessarily mean it was the same person in canon. It's more than likely that the person who rose through the ranks of the Thieves Guild, lead or disbanded the Dark Brotherhood, lead the Fighters Guild, etc. is in fact multiple different people. Hell, one could even interpret this as a legend that has had its quality and accuracy degrade over time. People see this mystical hero show up in history and legends, all while all these other things with the guilds happen at once, and just figure ""oh it's the same guy doing it"" even if that's not historically accurate."	811.0	5.0	4.0	1.0

It's not often at all and I moved on (long ago) - If it comes up (like in your question) I still have feelings about it. It was one of those absolutely right decisions that weren't in agreement in like logic and emotional stuff independent of each other (and both valid). I walked from a relationship with somebody who I truly loved. That was really difficult and I was emotionally crushed - Some time passed and I ran into this person later on in the most random of places in the world. These were both the happiest and most bitter of tears for me and it was raw on so many levels. We were going to get back together but I decided against it (again, and that was that). On paper, and in different healthy aspects of stuff in different domains of things, it was the right decision, but I'll never feel that way, and that's entirely ok.	835.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

All nonfiction. Truth is stranger than fiction. lol. Interesting trivia from the Wikipedia page for *Succession*: &gt; Showrunner Jesse Armstrong initially conceived the series as a feature film about the Murdoch family, but the script never went into production. Armstrong eventually expanded the scope of the story to include the larger landscape of Wall Street, which he felt better suited for a television format. &gt; &gt; Armstrong wrote a new script centered on original characters loosely inspired by various powerful media families such as the Murdochs (Fox), the Redstones (Viacom CBS) and the Sulzbergers (New York Times).

I imagine that arguments that sex/gender distinctions don't work could succeed, but this does not mean that the argument will go in favour of Bogardus. I imagine the arguments that are likely to succeed are Butler influenced ideas that we can't really pull apart sex and gender, but this is because sex is also something that is socially constructed, as opposed to the 'normal argument' that sex is all nice and solid while gender is an ephemeral floating idea, or the argument that Bogardus makes that sex is all nice and solid and ties down gender.	595.0	5.0	2.0	4.0

People are out here in this thread talking about which fictional characters could and would beat the shit out of us in a fight, but here's a case of characters being dangerous in more of a meta sense: Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. The popularity of Twilight -- driven in particular by its protagonists -- has normalized a lot of harmful, toxic ideas about relationships for a lot of girls right at the age when they're trying to figure out both their hormones and their place in the world. These are characters who send a message that abuse is an expression of love, controlling behavior is protective, and unequal power dynamics in a relationship are romantic and desirable. These characters are dangerous not because of what they can do in-universe, but *the effect they have on the reader* and the underlying philosophy behind their characterization. They are dangerous through the fourth wall.	897.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_ngsl14	gyskwav	ELI5: Why do clothes get wet easily but not towels? What makes them different???	If you're wondering why your towels are not absorbent, it's usually due to a buildup of detergent or fabric softener. Brand new towels have a coating applied by the manufacturer that can reduce how well they absorb. When towel manufacturers make their towels, they add silicone to the fabric to make the fabric feel softer on the retail shelf. Silicone negatively impacts the absorbency of the fabric because most silicones are hydrophobic (water repellent). Fortunately, much of the silicone washes off when you wash your towels. Edit: The other problem is that some towels are not 100% cotton, and have polyester or synthetic fibers in them. There is no hope for those towels, they should immediately be trashed.	714.0	5.0	1.0	3.0

t3_ni0kru	gyz7ys0	Married couples who have never fought (significantly) in your relationship, how do you do that?	"I think my wife and I had one stupid argument, but it was prompted by something else. The only thing you can do is to have conversations...but especially the awkward and uncomfortable, even painful, ones. You can learn to not hit back with snarky comments, and to take time to think about what you need to say. But you have to have the conversations to get any growth in the relationship. A lot of arguments are perpetual; they have no resolution. Gottman estimated that [around two-thirds of the arguments a couple has](https://www.gottman.com/blog/a-is-for-arguments/) are like this. A couple can revisit these to has them out again, even if they don't change; or, they can be left along. This means not needling your partner because they like something odd that you find awful, like eating spam. If one person is simply trying to provoke a reaction, that's simply being mean. I suspect that some personalities types are more likely to engage in an ""argument"" rather than a ""discussion."" But the underlying issues are probably similar.

The number is up to the developer and different developer change them in different way. A common way is the X.Y.Z variant. X is the major version number. Y in the minor version number. Z is the patch. So X changes when you consider is major changes. It might be that non backwards compatible charges, other major chages or just that you do that because you charge for uppdates to new major version. Y change when you do minor changes to the software. Z changes when you fix bugs or similar small changes. But that is just a common way to do it. As a developer you can do it anyway you like. You could release software and decrease the number start at 100 and next version is 99. It might be stupid thing to do and it confuse people that use it but you could do it There can be requirement of what to do if you use some external services like app stores to distribute the software so updates etc works	900.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_ni1aki	gyzgrnw	Do I have the right motivations for graduate school/ Am I pathetic?	This seems less like a youthful goal and more like a serious neurosis. In first order because this whole grad school project seems entirely hypothetical - you can apply, but as a person with a 10 year old degree, bad grades and no research experience, the amount of time and money it would take you to get in makes me think that you haven't really considered this seriously, because if you had, you'd immediately discard this option. I mean, if it means that much to you, throw caution to the wind and start over I guess - but when you're at the level of self-loathing you seem to be at, it's highly likely that achieving the goal isn't actually going to fix the self-loathing, because it's self-perpetuating at this point. Like, a late twenties person asking the internet if they're pathetic is a bit alarming from a how big is the hole inside perspective. If I were you, and I had the kind of money you'd need to invest in grad school prep, I'd take it and invest it in a good therapist.	989.0	4.0	5.0	4.0

He was buying some knee and elbow pads but they rang up for a higher price than what he saw to which I refuted saying these would never be that low of a price but he was insistent. Wal Mart managers didn't give a fuck about being helpful that late at night. It was only after 20 minutes of him arguing that a manager finally had to walk back with him to see and 10 minutes later, sure enough, he mis read the price and he didn't want them anymore. We moved on to his other items until it came time to pay. He was paying in three different ways and wanted $10 back on a check or debit card payment. He already gave the cash which was already entered and in the register. Minimum we can give back is $20. He wanted his cash back but I couldn't re-open the register to get the money or reset his balance to 0 without a managers approval.

Driving something bigger and heavier than anything else forces you to look ahead/ anticipate and predict further than a car/ van driver. See a green light 50 yards ahead, probably going to change so adjusting the speed is crucial, cannot just slam on at the last minute. Changing lanes on a motorway? In a car mirror signal mirror manoeuvre. Truck mirror signal, mirror, mirror, apply lock, mirror, manoeuvre. Always one idiot who tries to blast past. Roundabouts/ turns. Bigger vehicle equals greater turning circle. We need wider arcs to turn and thus sometimes need to use both lanes or encroach on other traffic lanes. However, in some turns you need the opposite lane that’s marked ie turning left at 90* you need the middle and or the right hand lane just to make the turn.

The head of the math department was fairly new and wasn't originally from our school, she had only been in the job like a week or something. She came into our class after the test to see how we'd done and basically accused me of not trying hard enough in front of everyone because they had higher scores than me. They knew I was struggling with this shit and yet my teacher never stood up for me. I was never one to talk back so I just sat there in silence as she ranted about how I was lazy and unwilling to learn, despite only being at the school for such a short time. I was pissed.

Both have romance, but it's next to a fascinating fantasy based plot, deep relationships between female characters, and excellent character development. What I really like about her books is that the heroines have goals and character development outside of the romance, and the romance doesnt solve all of their problems, while still being really compelling. Kristin Cashore's books are YA/NA with a slightly more romance focus, but similarly, her female characters all have goals and plot points that don't solely revolve around the love interest. The world building is really interesting. Graceling, Fire, Bitterblue, etc. Susan Dennard's Witchland series is super popular. While I didnt like the direction the plot took in later books, I know I'm in the minority, and it really fits the bill of what you described. Female POV (though there are multiple POV's including men), epic fantasy, multiple books to sink your teeth into. The romance is there, but it's a minor plot point for sure, at least in the first two books. S.A. Chakraborty's Daevabad Trilogy is fantastic. Honestly, if you pick any one of my suggestions, this is the one. It has everything, politics, magic, romance, excellent character development. I would say that the first 15% of the first book tricks you into thinking it's going to be a run of the mill fantasy romance in terms of plot, but really she's just setting up this complicated world with some plot beats that are more familiar to the reader. (At least that's my opinion of what's going on). The romance is there, but the plot is really more focused on character development and exploring issues of privilege and tribalism while luxuriating in this lush middle eastern setting. Lois McMaster Bujold's Sharing Knife series is slightly more romance focused than Witchlands or the Daevabad trilogy. But at 4 books, it's meaty, and there is a good fantasy adventure plot that takes equal space with the romance. I honestly recommend anything Lois McMaster Bujold writes.	2229.0	5.0	4.0	5.0
t3_njceew	gz6kjz5	How do you ensure you're growing(intellectually) everyday?	"Well. I'm not 100% sure these methods are what you're looking for. But they should help. First of all is revision. Knowledge is pointless if you don't know how to apply it. There are many ways to revise such as using mind maps and flash cards. But my favourite is taking notes. And repeating them trying to memorize as much of it as you can. For example you could write ""This is a note"" Next you would write as much of it from memory as you can. Allowing yourself to check the original note. Keep doing it until you can do it without having to look back. Another way of doing so is having questions and actively finding the answers. Part of why we're so advanced is because smart people kept asking questions. Realised there was no good answer and so they decided to try and work it out themselves. The questions can be something stupid like how to mathematically prove 1+1=2 or really complex like just about anything to do with particle physics"	946.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_njcik5	gz6kqsv	ELI5: How was the very first computer able to understand commands? How did they code a system to understand code in the first place?	The very first computers didn't understand computer code, they were programmed by hand using a series of switches. The famous Bronze Goddesses used to decode enigma during WW2 were programmed manually in this way. But you could argue they weren't true computers yet, as they were mono-task devices. Programming computers by hand was inefficient and impractical so the concept of the computer language was invented to be able to quickly program computers to perform repeatable tasks. Assembly languages were developed in the late 1940's which were the first computer languages. The computer processors were designed in parallel with the language in the same way that you design a car with a steering wheel and pedals otherwise you wouldn't have a way of driving it. The limits of assembler however is that you need an extremely high degree of understanding of computers and their operation to use it. It isn't practical for anything but the most basic of functions. To make computers do more we invented high-level programming languages that would act as an interface between humans and complex computer logic. Essentially creating a tool that allowed humans to write the logic (a computer program) and then translate it into assembler using a tool called a compiller. The first such language was IBMs FORTRAN created in the late 50's. Higher level languages like C came much much later. The compilers of those languages transform the easier to read code into assembler (machine code) underneath that the processor can understand. Modern languages like HTML, PhP, JAVA etc go a step further in that they produce code meant to be translated by an intermediary program, which in many cases is the browser. The browser in this case is the interface that transforms web code into machine language.	1792.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_njd7w2	gz7d6u0	Is it ever worth it to read older editions of philosophical works?	It really depends! Different translations have different strengths and weaknesses. It also depends on the purpose of your reading. Some translations (like the Irwin of EN) are more accessible english than others that may be more faithful to the original Greek (like the Ross as a classic translation). How old a translation is may just mean some of the commentary or a word here and there will be a dated term (Burnyeat, for instance, is a pretty timeless translator but has a few things here and there that are funky.) On the whole, though, the year something was translated and published doesn’t really correspond to much else quality-wise. A lot of times you can look up translation reviews and places like Bryn Mawr Classics Review and others will have thorough write-ups comparing the different translations. In general, though, I think it’s fair to say that a big publisher will tend to put out a solid translation. Newer does not necessarily mean better. Ross, Irwin, Akrill, all great Aristotle translators.	1015.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
t3_njdded	gz6tkol	ELI5: Do things have limited scent/odor molecules? If you leave a spoiled piece of fish out does it stop smelling bad eventually?	You are asking two different questions entirely. To answer your first, no; if something has a scent, as long as there is any piece of that thing, it will have that scent. If it's reduced to a few molecules, it might be too faint for humans to smell with our noses, but the scent is there, however faint, until the molecules are removed or converted into different molecules. Spoiled fish smells bad due to bacteria decomposition, not the fish, so that's why your second question isn't very accurate. When the bacteria completely decompose the fish so that there are no more fish molecules, then the scent of the fish will be gone. Long before then, the odor of the bacterial byproducts will overwhelm our sense of smell and make us throw out the fish. Eventually the bacterial byproducts would stop smelling when they became broken down into other materials, but that would take a while. Please don't perform this experiment.	925.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_nkki4f	gzfea7n	ELI5 : How are videogame codes protected ?	Some of the explanations on here are going into a separate issue (recovering source code). This really has nothing to do with what OP is asking. OP you are right that in theory a program can be transferred to other computers simply by transferring all the files. In fact this is exactly what people used to do back in the day and it worked. I remember when software companies started to require a serial number (usually found on the physical packaging). You would need a valid serial number or the software wouldn’t run. At first, software would check that a serial number was valid based on an algorithm it ran itself. Later when the internet became prevalent, software would require an online validation of a serial number. Now that most software does not come in a physical box, the protections are all happening behind the scenes I would assume. I’m sure any major software company has piracy protection built into their software. So to answer your question, yes it is possible in concept but highly illegal and most software has hidden protections to prevent you from successfully doing this.	1097.0	5.0	5.0	3.0
t3_nkkmw8	gzdc64n	Should scalping be illegal? Why/why not?	Yes. A limited product shouldn't bought to be price gouged. Again I veto bots auto buying the stock, and also set a limit on how many people can buy something. Reality that will never hold enough ground. Why? Limited things are limited. They will only appreciate in value over time which is frustrating but not immoral. However a shortage based things will gradually zero out after new supply is induced into the market. A good example is people were casuing gas shortage and then scalping gas by selling it 5 times the msrp for profit. I myself have scalped/flipped things. However it never is a public necessity. Nor a shortage based item. Rather limited edition/classics no longer in production. Buy cheap sell high to buyers who are willing to pay such premiums. I usually will enjoy the item before I grew bored of it. My dream is to one day own a 964 Porsche n Ford GT, but the reality is they are limited n prices always increasing. Hence I will never be able to obtain it. That isn't scalping just a limited item out of production	1038.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

She also felt the urge to text us several times not to come if it inconvenienced us in any way. So of course we had to prove a point. My roomie went to the grocery store and got fresh fruit and stuff, I got out my freshbox and made her a big bunch of pancakes, chocolate sauce, filled a small bottle with syrup, my roomie made fruit salat and prepared berries. We packed the hot pancakes into the freshbox so they'd stay hot, packed a small mini table, some silverware, my best plates and a pretty kitchen towel and went over right in time for her break. The we served her the still warm pancakes dinner style, we even plated it in front of everyone and served her cooled orange juice in my best wine glass.

I had alot of bad stuff happen as well which really changed the way I viewed the military (I won't disclose too much here) but I did travel alot as well, but it's pushed me towards the door because I realise as a person I was never really the fit for the military and in fact sometimes the mold for the ideal military person is well, a little bit boring and non progressive.

t3_nkny0h	gzdtazf	ELI5: if gold bullion is a good investment, why do companies sell it?	The best way to make money in any market over the long term is to broker transactions and take a piece of every trade. Price goes up and some people buy in while others take their profits off the table - great, charge them both for every sale. Price goes down and some people scoop in to pick up a bargain while others cut their losses - great, charge them both for every sale. Either way, you don't get stuck with the asset itself, and you're largely immune to short and medium term trends. Some precious metal dealers maintain a small inventory which they use to be on one or the other side of a trade, but for the most part, even that is designed to be a way to bring buyers and sellers together rather than an actual investment the dealer uses to make money. It's more nuanced of course, but better to make a buck on each of 10,000 hundred dollar trades every week (whether prices are rising or falling) than than buy a million dollars worth of assets today and hope you can sell them for $1,010,000 next week.	1014.0	4.0	4.0	3.0

I am not a medical professional, but have have tried to do my own experimentation with this. First of all, each person is different. My wife never flosses and they always tell her she has been doing a fantastic job. She has shallow pockets and no bleeding at all. For me, I need to brush 2 full minutes twice a day, plus floss every day for 5 weeks straight to get glowing reviews. If it's less than that then you can try flossing twice a day, but usually the 5 weeks is minimum for me. This will dramatically reduce pocket depths and stop bleeding to the point where you will not only avoid scolding, but be praised for your teeth. Note that I use a sonicare toothbrush...

Giga for 1,000,000,000 and tera for 1,000,000,000,000,000 was added in 1960 Computer memory is addressed binary so it is multiples of 2, not 10. 1024 is a multiple of 2 and people started to be called 1024 a kilo because it was very close in size The same way you get a * mega of 1024*1024=1,048,576* * *gigi 1024*1024*1024=1,073,741,824* * *tera 1024*1024*1024*1024=1,099,511,627,776 For giga the variant with 1024 is 7% larger than the 1000 variants The storage medium is sold with units using 1000 and it tends to be stated on the packaging and websites of the manufacturers Operating systems tend to use the 1024 definition. So a 64 GB memory card will be 64\*1000^(3/10243) =59.6 with the 1024 usage 32 GB will be 29.8. So there is not extra storage but different units. The file system will use some space but it is not a lot.	1049.0	5.0	4.0	4.0
t3_nlvy0t	gzl404y	Is Utilitarianism really that bad?	"&gt; I am reading 'An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation' by Bentham right now, but whenever I hear people saying utilitarianism is stupid, I feel really bad about reading it. Don't feel bad for reading Bentham, he's an important philosopher. Read utilitarians, both because utilitarianism is a significant and still pretty popular philosophical view, and because there are many utilitarian philosophers who are important to understanding contemporary ethical philosophy, like Bentham, Mill, Paley, Sidgwick, Singer, etc. &gt; One of the main ones I hear is that there are certain things that are obviously unjust, but would be permissible according to Utilitarianism. I don't get this one, isn't the response to that just... no, it isn't unjust (assuming they don't give you an actual reason why said thing is unjust, but only say what I wrote above)? That's what the utilitarian will have to say, but think about it this way: if I say things that sound obviously wrong all the time, and when called out on it I say it follows from willbellianism, wouldn't you just say ""I don't care, you're still obviously wrong, and how frequently you're obviously wrong is a mark against willbellianism""? &gt; And when they do give a reason I find that, whether they know it or not, the reason is Utilitarian itself. Utilitarians make arguments of this kind, but I think the claim is *prima facie* implausible. You can possibly consequentialize deontological theories, but most philosophers wouldn't say that makes their reasons utilitarian. Even authors that are optimistic about consequentializing don't really seem to believe that (e.g. ""In defense of consequentializing"" by Dreier)."	1696.0	3.0	5.0	3.0

Kinda like quicksand - you sink in slowly and get firmly stuck. So to avoid the friendzone, act now. You'll want to avoid getting into the friendzone, not let yourself get put there and then try to get out. On the other hand, it's easier to leave the dateable zone, so if you go out a couple times and you don't click in that way, you can decide to be just friends *after* you've given going on a date a shot.	853.0	5.0	5.0	4.0

t3_nlxig9	gzm1hnb	ELI5: How can USB-C standard be updated to now support 240W power delivery when the plug size and number of pins don't change?	When two devices are connected, they negotiate power delivery. When a cable is plugged in, the power delivery pins are set to 5V, 2A, 10W. Then other pins receive a message that indicates the version of the protocol. In the first version, a device then sends a message that indicates which one of the five profiles to change to (the sixth was unused). These are specific power delivery amounts - 10W, 18W, 36W, 60W, 100W. The second version of the standard allows the device to select a specific voltage (5V, 9V, 15V, 20V), and then provides a way to fine tune the wattage from there. The messages allow 0.5W changes to the power delivered. The third version allows even finer grain control. The messages allow 20 mV changes to the power delivered. The fourth version, the new one, allows a larger range of voltages up to 50V to be selected. The other device has the opportunity to say it doesn't support the version requested. The devices will see if they both support each version, newest to oldest, until they can agree on a version or the basic 10W is used.	1061.0	4.0	2.0	4.0

t3_nmz9i7	gzrjf20	ELI5: Why does the order of a resistor not matter in a series circuit?	Imagine you connect several pipes to supply water somewhere. The pipes have different diameters. The bigger diameter - the more water can fo through that single pipe in a period of time. I.e. speed of water (current) depends on pipe size. When connected in a series, the pipe with smallest diameter sets the limit for water flow speed (maximum current) for the whole pipe system. You can't make the water flow faster than it can flow through the smallest pipe The same principles are applicable for electric current. The wire is a pipe, the electric current (directed flow of charges, for example electrons) like a waterflow. The resistance is a value that depends on wire section area in inverse proportion. Also the voltage can be seen as a height difference between the pipe ends. If pipe is horisontal the difference is zero (no voltage), the water (and electrons) are not going anywhere. When pipe is not horisontal, the difference sets pushes water and electrons through the pipe (wire) and sets the speed (electric current strength, amperage). The sign of that difference (positive or negative polarity) sets the direction for current flow.

Then I got to have a 1 on 1 meeting with him. This is usually where the head coach makes his big pitch and tries to sell the program to you. No, not Petrino. This guy gave me a list of reasons why I needed a place like Louisville, a staff like this, and then told me to give him one good reason why I couldn't commit to him right there on the spot.

t3_nn4bmn	gzsg7q5	ELI5: How does an automobile's gearing affect its torque versus its top speed?	"If you've ever ridden a bicycle with gears you can get a really direct example of this. If you go uphill, it's REALLY difficult in a higher gear, in a lower gear you can peddle easily and get your mass moving but you'll have to peddle faster doing it. Same for a car, with the ""effort"" in modern engines being analogous to dumping in more fuel in an attempt to provide enough power until the point it bogs down or the torque converter just starts slipping. Conversely, you can only peddle so fast no matter how little effort it can take and engines can only run at so high an RPM. So if you're not trying to get up a hill, pull something heavy, whatever, that low gear will leave you spinning like mad but not getting anywhere fast, you've got to spin the tires more times to speed up and you can't spin the power source any faster so you change the ratio of power source spins to wheel spins, ie you shift into a higher gear. ""Overdrive"" refers to this ratio going beyond 1.0, meaning the transmission output is spinning more than 1 time, maybe 1.1 for example, for every rotation of the engine/pedals. Really fast cars need to have a high max RPM and hogh available gear ratios to avchieve those speeds while making enough power to fight things like air resistance, the rolling resistance of tires and the friction in the drivetrain. Cars also have a gearing in the axle, usually somewhere in the 3-4 ish range, which means that for every 3-4 rotations of the transmission output, the wheela will rotate once. This has the same relationship to speed/power as the transmission ratio. Numerically higher axle ratios (more driveshaft turns per wheel turn) provide a mechanical advantage for power, but require a higher RPM to achieve the same speed, all else equal. These higher numbers are seen in trucks, off road vehicles trying to fight the inertia of large tires, and drag vehicles where acceleration is prioritized over high top speed (up to a point of diminishing returns anyway). You'll also often see higher axle gearing in vehicles with the smallest available engine for that model since it allows the manufacturer to provide more mechanical advantage to the weak engine without having to build a different transmision with more advantageous gear ratios. Numerically lower ratios are seen in high cruising speed cars and in commuter vehicles that want to either maximize speed at a given RPM (optimizing for high cruise speed) OR that are trying to maximize fuel efficiency while cruising (lower rpm for a given speed means the cylinders firing fewer times means less fuel used). Gearing is always a trade off. You can only go so low before it's imptactically slow and demands way too high an RPM from the engine. You can only go so high before the engine can't produce enough power to keep the vehicle moving, it eventually needs more mechanical advantage from the gears to get the job done."	2901.0	4.0	4.0	4.0

The speed of tech development in my lifetime is unparalleled throughout the whole of human history. With the possible exceptions of electricity and the internal combustion engine, I don't think the world has ever witnessed such fast-paced development and adaptation of technology with such massive consequences for both our working lives and day-to-day living: last night I summoned food to my doorstep with the same rectangle I'm holding in my hand to type this comment. For my generation and younger ones, this rapid change is normal. Think about the fact that it's normal for us to watch a piece of technology become obsolete half-a-decade after its invention. I have never owned anything on Blu-ray. I went from VHS to DVD to pirating to streaming. I skipped an entire invention and barely noticed. But all this change is becoming exhausting. I don't want to ever have to learn a new OS. I hate that so much software requires its own app or account (for data mining.) I'm having to constantly Google 'How to...' to trouble-shoot a device or learn my way around an app that's suddenly become essential for online teaching. And then the app gets an update and all the settings are in the wrong place and its background is now yellow.

The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of woodland, the sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere, far in the empty sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."" The idea was that hardly anyone would have the stamina to make it all the way to ""far in the sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing,"" and would skip to the next paragraph without ever wondering what the heck Twain was talking about.

It can be very difficult to keep writing yourself at a pace you're unused to, especially when you have other things demanding your time and brain power.

Is that correct? Consider taking some time for your other hobbies, the ones you set aside for writing. Spend time there and let your mind work up to the last few chapters of your book. Make notes when you think of something, and when you've had a break, dive back in. I know you want to get this done, but don't be too hard on yourself if it takes longer than you think it should.

I suffer from [delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder), so I've had the unfortunate opportunity to learn quite a bit about this. First, what people are saying about sleeping outside of your circadian rhythm is true. Your body has a sleep cycle it likes to adhere to, you can sleep outside of it, but it's almost always significantly worse in quality. However, what most of people are claiming to affect circadian rhythm is actually pretty shallow research. Certain things seem to be more important than others, like exposure to daylight; but the problem is that there isn't one overarching indicator. People just respond to too many different variables in too many different ways to have a completely successful measure on it. What causes your own circadian rhythm isn't always so simple.

t3_noashh	gzz0fp9	Ambidextrous people, what were the cons you've experienced for being one?	I went through private education in school and they saw early on that I used both hands. They tried to change that and force me right handed, so in school I wrote right handed and at home I wrote left handed. The only thing that sucks about it is my handwriting is kinda shit. Unsure how true it is but basically I’ve been told that if you’re ambidextrous you lose a bit of control in certain areas (both hands aren’t dominant/ one isn’t dominant because both get used kind of thing which means that you won’t be as good as someone with a dominant hand) again unsure how true it is. The only thing for me is truly my handwriting, I was always told it’s because “boys don’t have good writing skills” but I have plenty of other male friends who write beautifully and I’m over here with chicken scratch. Plus side? My cursive with my left hand? Gorgeous. If I write letters I use a calligraphy pen and will give it some real love, but that’s very few and far between cause ain’t nobody got time for that.	1001.0	3.0	4.0	4.0

t3_nobik4	gzzmlgi	ELI5: What causes increase in saliva during running?	"So, the study you linked actually DID find an increase in saliva flow rate with exercise, but that was in CONTRAST to previous studies that had found saliva flow to be *decreased* or *unaltered* by exercise. (The water component of saliva is normally secreted during RECOVERY / non stressful type stimuli, aka your parasympathetic nervous system, while proteins such as amylase in saliva are normally secreted during STRESSFUL type stimuli, aka your sympathetic nervous system.) Since they weren't expecting that, and it wasn't the main objective of their study, they weren't really ready with an explanatory discussion of that result. The best they gave was that the exercise environment was kinda cold (10 degrees Celsius, which is 50 degrees Fahrenheit) which could have stimulated saliva flow, and that they were exercising in that relatively cold room for only 20 minutes and ""under these circumstances dehydration is expected to be limited."" Usually, the general explanation is that it's not so much an increase in saliva as it is an increase in the THICKNESS (viscosity) of your saliva, which feels uncomfortable in the mouth, and so we are more aware of it and more motivated to spit than usual. The increased viscosity is usually thought to be caused by the dehydration of your oral tissue from evaporation during heavy mouth breathing, but the study you linked above shows an alternative explanation, which is the increased production of MUC5B - a mucus-making protein - during exercise. (They noted that this was counterintuitive, since MUC5B is usually secreted during parasympathetic response, aka recovery and not stress, but again since this was an unexpected result they don't have a super strong explanation for it yet.) The purpose of mucus is to catch unwanted matter in your airway and glom onto it, so that it can more easily be moved along up and out of your airway (ideally cough it out). There is mucus in your lower airway, which is super important for protecting it, but your salivary glands also produce mucins (mucus-making proteins) as well. The study you linked above found that when you exercise, your salivary glands make much more of multiple different proteins, so the protein concentration of your saliva goes up. This is probably due to your glands being stimulated by substances that get released in your body during stress (exercise is definitely stress, to your body). One of those proteins is the mucin MUC5B, one of the guys that determines how viscous (thick) your saliva is. This study found that MUC5B concentration increases with exercise, which is another explanation for the increased viscosity of your spit and therefore the need TO spit. Tldr: it's more that the viscosity increases and makes you feel the need to spit it out. New evidence suggests flow may also increase but not super clear on why yet."	2852.0	4.0	3.0	4.0

t3_nobsk0	gzz5k7w	People who have proposed, what made you sure it was the right moment?	Because I spoke with her about it. I knew she wanted to marry me because we talked about marriage, and whole that meant she knew I was gonna do it, she had no idea when or where. We spoke about what lives we wanted, personal goals, etc. We got it all figured out to makes sure it's what we both wanted and since it was, I was ready to propose. This also meant no chance of being publicly turned down, or her having to awkwardly say yes and tell me no later.	457.0	4.0	4.0	4.0

t3_nocjq7	gzzak9d	What are some summery activities that kids can do without going outside?	Since the problem is sunlight, I assume that she can go outside in the evening, right? Or is she just house bound? If it was my son (7yo), the first step would be to change his sleep schedule, to wake up later, go to bed later. That way, she could enjoy the outside in evening or much later in the day because I suppose her bedtime is between 7pm and 8pm? As for during the day activities, if you have the space for it, bring a small inflatable pool inside and “go to the beach” with a picnic or something. The same would apply for an area with sand, if she is allowed to get dirty (I don’t know if she still has stitches or if the wounds are closed). Not for everyday, but once in a while. Family barbecues in the evening, strolls in the evening and so on, as long as your parents are up for a change in her schedule. I know they might love their “alone time” in the evening, but keeping a 5yo for the whole summer inside during day is going to be hard… My son broke his arm when he was 5, in the spring, and he couldn’t ride his bike and just that was hell.	1059.0	1.0	1.0	2.0
t3_nockdv	h015e6q	How do philosophers use logic in their work?	Good responses here about how logic is used by philosophers. I'd only add that learning and practicing formal logic is for intellectual pursuits what strength training and exercise is for physical pursuits. A footballer doesn't need to do pushups or lift weights on the field, but doing so off the field makes them more effective at what they do. This is not the primary reason you'd learn formal logic, but it's one benefit.	425.0	1.0	2.0	2.0

t3_nod25r	gzzc3rr	To those who have difficulty socialising, have social anxiety, etc.. what are some ways to make you feel more comfortable in a social setting?	The best option is to position yourself right next to someone that you are close with, engage in conversations with the person you are close with and have your good buddy lead you through new conversations with other people. If you are not familiar with anyone, there are 2 options you can choose. 1. Position yourself towards a corner of the room to avoid social interaction. 2. Position yourself close to a group of people, try to interact with some people in the group and blend in with the group using the acquaintances you formed Option 2 may make you feel more uncomfortable at first but in the end it is the option that makes you feel the most comfortable in the end since you won't have the anxiety of getting judged for being alone.	741.0	4.0	4.0	4.0
