I've been in your spot before, and it's one of the worst things ever. I actually seriously tried offing myself years back by partial hanging after the better part of a year of barely leaving my bed (I literally only left for food and bathroom needs). It's completely soul crushing what your mind can do to itself. I'll tell you this though - as I was hanging there, after about 20 minutes of not passing out (which should have taken seconds), I came to a realization - if I'm trying this hard to end myself, why not just put that effort into life? The worst that could happen is failure and death, which is what I was just going for anyway, so why not hang on and see what else life has in store for me? So I hung on.\n\nA while later, I got married, and had a kid (and a stepdaughter). Being a providing father was my life, and working for my family really gave me purpose. I eventually couldn't handle the job anymore and went back on disability. We struggled, but were mostly happy and loving. Then, a little over a year ago, I found my 2 year old daughter dead in her crib. SIDS. Worst fucking thing imaginable, even counting years of horrors I've been through. We did what we could to move forward, but the previous financial strain and the loss of purpose was just too much.\n\nMy wife left me in April. You'd think this is where it gets darker. But no, I refuse to let depression have that strong of a hold on me again. I found a better job, and quickly became store manager. I got my own place again. My purpose in life now? Improving myself. I've been working on myself my whole life, but now I'm going it alone, adamant to retain happiness, myself, for myself. It's not easy, and I do sometimes go back to that dark place, but I refuse to backside too far.\n\nMy point here? Just keep pushing, and never stop, no matter how much life fucks with you. You are worthy of love and respect, don't let your sickness tell you different. You are not alone, and while I know you probably don't feel strong right now, I know you have it in you. Don't give up on yourself, and do the best you can with what you got. And please, message me if you ever need to talk.\n\nHope you have a happy new year. Welcome in the new year with a determined, positive new mindset, and never give up! You have more inner strength than you realize, and you owe it to yourself to utilize it. Best wishes!", "annotations": []}

{"id": "58", "text": "I think what I struggle with is having read the scriptures I see a lot of God \"warning\" his people about things and wonder why I didn't get something like that.\n\nRegardless, I appreciate your response. I would imagine being a parent is hard when it comes to letting your kids make their own choices.<SPLIT_TOKEN>I forgot to tell you that I really am sorry for your situation. A similar thing happened to one of my best friends a few years ago and it nearly destroyed him. It's not easy.\n\n&gt; I think what I struggle with is having read the scriptures I see a lot of God \"warning\" his people about things and wonder why I didn't get something like that.\n\nThat's a fair question. I've had some bad things happen to me and I've learned that it's ok to ask \"Why me?\" as long as it's a _productive_, searching question (as opposed to the \"woe is me\" approach). Here are some things I've learned during my hard times:\n\n* The scriptures are a highlight reel of God's dealings with mankind over the course of hundreds of years. As such, using them as a benchmark can set us up for disappointment. For example, the BoM has a single chapter dedicated to an _entire century_. Think of all the good, bad and ugly things that happened to the hundreds of thousands of individuals during that time. They had families, happiness, tragedies, deaths, betrayals, miracles, etc. Apparently none of it was exceptional or unique enough to make the cut. Similarly, the scriptures have hundreds of accounts where people were warned of bad things, yet there are _billions_ of times when people aren't warned. You and I aren't the exception, we are the rule!\n* If God warned us before every bad thing was about to happen, that still sets us up to be pretty weak. It's much easier to handle something when we can brace for it. If the purpose of us being here is to grow and develop, warning us every step of the way is counterproductive. Besides, do you _really_ want a God that steps in and warns you of everything that's about to go wrong? You'd be a mess! :)\n* This is more tongue-in-cheek but who knows, maybe God _did_ warn you and you weren't paying attention?\n* This one is the most important so I've saved it for last. Bad things happen and it's up to us to determine how it shapes our lives. If you let it, your divorce (and everything leading up to it) can and will destroy you. It can make you a bitter, unhappy person that can never trust another again. However, it's also possible the exact opposite is true. Your divorce can teach you things about yourself and others that you'd never, ever be able to learn in any other way. That puts you in a position where you can help other people, warn other people, and perhaps be there to comfort someone else that you are uniquely qualified to comfort. Who knows, maybe _that_ person is \"the one\" for you and the only way you'd be able to meet (and deserve) her is because you've gone through this. My point is, sometimes bad things, even really bad things, have long term consequences that only make sense in hindsight. What's happened has happened, so it's now in your control to determine what's next. Will it destroy you or empower you? Are you setting yourself up so that in 20 years you can look back on this and say, \"Ah, that sucked but it sure made me a better person\"? Focus on what you can control: you.\n\n&gt; Regardless, I appreciate your response. I would imagine being a parent is hard when it comes to letting your kids make their own choices.\n\nIt certainly can be. That's also what makes it all so great, too. You do your best to teach your kids how to be a good little human and then there comes a moment when they make a good decision on their own, or they pick themselves up after falling, or they share a candy with another kid without coaxing... and it feels so good. There's nothing else in the world like it.\n\nYou can't have the good without the bad. You can't ever see them excel on their own if you've never let them fail on their own, too. You can only feel \"meh\" good if you've only felt \"meh\" bad. Opposition in all things, man.", "annotations": []}

{"id": "111", "text": "Yeah, I was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer 2 months after my first child was born, I had immigrated to America and built myself a perfect life despite a number of failings and struggles along the way, I had an a typical reaction to the radiation treatments that left my with an extraordinary amount of scar tissue in my abdomen so even a year later after being cleared I am on a bunch of pain killers and live my life in pain 24/7. I used to be a mountaineer and ice hockey player as well, I loved being active and outside, the cancer has stolen everything I value in my life, I am unable to be the husband I promised my wife I would be, I lost 60lbs of muscle and most my hair which at this point o don't think is coming back and my wife is super attractive and I look like I came from a concentration camp,  I am unable to be a good father to my child, I am pretty close to being broke and constantly stress over trying to get into work and keep my job, I  am no longer capable of doing the things I used to live for....beyond that I'm just a disgusting piece of shit now, the surgery severed a bunch of nerve endings so my dick barely works, I piss or shit my pants on occasion simply because I have no sensation down there and spent the last year and a half shitting in bag....\n\nevery single fucking day I want to kill myself if nothing more than to just make the pain and suffering go away, mix that in with the stress of day to day life, letting everyone you love and care about down and dragging them along through years of heart ache it gets real fucking tough to just keep going.\n\nPoint being, this is the only sub where I let that shit out man, I don't talk to anyone about this in irl and really getting into it on the level you are wanting is to fucking hard, so I come here and make some stupid comment like the ones you are complaining about and move on with my life, no one can help me, my problems are what they are and it's not like even talking to a therapist is going to stop the pain, so what's the point of going into it?\n\nThis place is exactly the sort of outlet I need to just laugh at my miserable existence and carry on with my life....\n\n\nIt's much more likely that I would actually go through with it if forced to confront the situation and myself in the way you are suggesting, it's so much easier to just be stupid about it, have a sad laugh and carry on.\n\nBut hey everyone is different and I get that...it seems you don't however, as this place is what it is because of people like me with their own set of problems, everyone handles things differently and while posts here are mostly people being funny there are people like myself mixed in and you really shouldn't criticize this sub because people like me honestly need it, if it's not for you and it offends you there are more than enough places for you to go and cry it out in a circle of strangers, there is nowhere else I know of that I can make light of my shitty life and situation like I do here....the best part is while not everyone maybe as fucked up as I am it's good to know that other people feel the same and the ones you call fake or whatever are still funny..... only salty assholes get into that whole thing of \"they have nothing to complain about, my life is harder\" type of bullshit, lighten up it's a joke and beyond that just because you are going through some major bullshit it doesn't mean that other people's lives aren't tough as well or that they shouldn't be allowed to be upset over spilled coffee or whatever..... \n\nI know I will get told off for this but I don't fucking care,  I believe it to be the truth more so than ever, suicide is selfish, it really is, if I was a single guy with no family you better fucking believe I would have just downed a bottle of my pain killers ages ago, but making my 32 yo wife a widow and my 2 yo son fatherless is the ONLY reason I am here to shit post today, the only thing that outweighs my desire to end the pain and torment is my sense of duty and respect for my wife, though I have thought on a number of occasions that I would be doing her a favor...what I personally want differs from my obligations, we face this problem a lot in our lives why should it be different with our deaths?  I really don't care what anyone says, I made promised and obligations I have people who tell me they need me, to ignore all of that is selfish no two ways about it.... Now I can understand why someone would go through with it anyways, I really really do and wouldn't fault them for it, they just became to weak and weary to carry on and there is absdolutely nothing wrong with that, nothing, but it is still selfish. \n\n....I've ranted enough, sorry, I woke up at 3 am about to shit myself again and had to take a bunch of painkillers, I hope my bullshit at least makes a little bit of sense.\n\nPs.

Scumbag multinational corporations like SCI and Arbor have bought up thousands of local mom and pop funeral homes. They make billions guilting grieving families into buying extra services they don't need and lying to them about what's required for funerals.\n\nHere's a quick sample of the lies I was told when my little brother died a few months ago:\n\n* *You need to pay to have the body embalmed. It's the law! For safety!* You do not, and it is not. There's nothing unsanitary or unsafe about a dead body unless they had an infectious disease. And I was having him cremated. Why would you embalm a body that you're about to cremate?\n\n* *You must buy a casket for a cremation. We need something to hold the body in.* Nope. When I finally found a non-shady funeral home (shout out to Trinity Funeral Home in Edmonton, by the way), I witnessed my brother's cremation\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was no container at all! They just wrapped him up in cloth (probably for my sake since they removed his eyes during the autopsy) and popped him in the oven.\n\n* *You need to purchase a special urn to hold the ashes in after the cremation.* Wrong again. All funeral directors will provide a little plastic box to hold the ashes in as part of their direct cremation costs.\n\n* *It's illegal to spread their ashes, you need to have them interred at our cemetery.* Nope, nope, double nope. You can spread human ashes on any private property (with permission of the property owner) and on most Crown land in Alberta (with several notable exceptions, like national parks\u00e2\u0080\u0094our funeral director was really helpful in deciphering this for us). You do not need to pay for a cemetery plot.\n\nAll said and done, those scumbags at Arbor were prepared to charge me a minimum of $13,000 to take care of my brother's remains. I got a direct cremation done for a little over $1000 after tax, and this summer we're spreading his ashes up near the lake Dad and him liked to camp at.\n\nAnd yeah, these online obituary guys are scummy too.

When we first started dating he told me right away that he had a pill problem after high school so that if I heard anything along the lines of him being an addict that he had addressed the problem already and was better. He also was very moody at times especially after I started calling him out because my friends pointed out to me that he clearly had a problem due to him nodding out at any parties we attended together. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also nod out at home when we would hang out which really bothered me since I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand that that was a tell tale sign.

Must have been a very scary experience for him but, selfishly, I mostly remember the impact it had on my life.

He was covered in scars from neck to wrist and had to have surgery and skin grafts. I remember thinking he looked like edward scissor hand the first time I saw him after he was released from the hospital, so pale and thin, covered in bandages and cuts. He was so spaced out and very sensitive to noises and what you said. He couldn't handle any confrontation or negative words, even on tv. He tried to overdose on his meds one night and I had to call the police while my mum tried to stop him from leaving the house. It was rather traumatic for me. I rememeber having to describe to the operator what he was wearing and what he looked like. He was wearing a pair of pants with black and white checkers on them. When the police and ambulance arrived to take him back to the psych ward the officer said to my mother and I that he was being a drama queen and if he really wanted to kill himself he'd just do it. I was crying and he asked me why and told me to calm down. \nI ended up missing so many days of school just not being able to face up and go in the midst of so much turmoil at home. It tore my family apart, to be honest. My sister lived away from home so didn't have to experience it as much. My mother held it together and looked after him until he was better but the whole ordeal stressed her out so much she had a year-long depressive episode and I had to go into foster care, give my dog up for adoption, give up my sports team and resented my mother and brother for doing this to me for a long time.

{"id": "181", "text": "Hey /u/DrMcClimateChange thank you for taking the time to write this up. \n\nI'm just going to get this off my chest since it's the only thing bothering me about your post. Don't call me kid, I just got into the game late in life after being a loser after high school. Don't assume everyone just coming out of college is some 21yo kid who's never lived outside their parent's home. Now that that's off my chest:\n\n* I agree that my work needs to improve and I also need to update my website. Some of my work is still from college since my last job didn't really provide me with any portfolio worthy work. I would love to specialize but i'm still having trouble trying to find my niche in the design community.\n\n* Correct, I need more experience. I wholeheartedly agree!\n\n* I agree that I need to move. This place (Central PA) is devoid of like minded individuals. There are a few here and there, but they are scarce.\n\n* Yes, I should work on my attitude. I know that employers demand a certain degree of respect considering they sign my paycheck but it really rubs me the wrong way when upper management treats entry level employees like lesser beings. Respect is a two way street and it's really hard for me to not say fuck off.\n\n* I feel my social skills are where they need to be but like you mentioned earlier geographically I'm not where I need to be.\n\n* I didn't even know you could apprentice in the design world. I thought that was more of a trade thing. Could you elaborate?\n\n* I've never really been good at taking care of myself. I always try to please other people but after a recent trip I've decided to just worry about what it is I want out of life. I made a lot of life changes over the last few months and I think it honestly brought things to a head where I was at. I went and met a lot of like minded artists from across the US and had an amazing time. When I came back to the same disgruntled people in small town PA I just got fed up. My gut told me it was time to just leave. Damn the consequences.\n\n* I do what I have to do to make it. It took me a really long time to finally get to college and better myself. I guess it was just a real kick in the balls to finally reach that milestone in my life only to get treated like shit on the other side. I already sold off my camera equipment and am selling pretty much everything I can part with to make it out of this situation.\n\nI really do appreciate your insight and will take a lot of this to heart. Thanks again and I hope you have an amazing new year!<SPLIT_TOKEN>Hey, take a breather. I'm a bit confused by the previous post myself, no idea why it's so full-on, you're definitely not a newbie designer loser of some sort who has a long laundry list of things to do before you're able to get a job again.

Last check I had they found 2, and they were dead. But my cancer doctor and urologist were God damn badasses and made sure I had samples before chemo, like \"nah dude we cut it out, you're good, go jerk off in a cup for a week or 2 so we can start chemo\", and livstrong paid for most of my sample preservation.\n\nLivstrong also paid for a big chunk of in vitro, and we tried that. Wife dropped 18 eggs I think, and 15 were good, and 10 fertilized. Somehow managed to get great embryos from my fucked up cancer sack, but the first one didn't stick. It's another 3k to implant another, and the fertility doctor can't understand why it didn't take. Since my case is different for the fertility clinic, and my wife is not the one with firtility issues, the doctor suguested we try atrificial insemenation, kind of a, fuck it we gotta use the whole sample anyway hail Mary play. Just before Christmas we had my wife all jacked up on hormones again and we tried the good ole turkey baster method, layman's terms lol, and Thursday we go for a pregnancy test. Fingers crossed. \n\nBasically what I'm gettin at is I feel you man, it's fucking hard to want something so bad and to be denied over and over. It's hard not to blame yourself.

He died as a result of a hit-and-run, so not really a murder or abduction, and there's precious little information out there. He still haunts me in a way few others have. I wish that little boy and his family could get justice.\n\nBut to summarize: \n\n11-year-old Maurice walked to and from school. He likely crossed State Street regularly to get there. State Street is a main drag in East Saint Louis, IL. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavily used, a four-lane road. He was right at the crossroad of Post Street near a bus stop. Still, no matter how many times he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d made that walk before, this walk was different because he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it home. \n\nSomeone hit the fourth-grader that rainy March day. There were no skid marks. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even try to stop. There may or may not have been witnesses; no one ever came forward, not that police released, anyway, and no one stopped initially. In fact, people just kept driving past. No, Maurice wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t knocked into the shoulder or a ditch. He was in the middle of the road where people could easily see him, injured, quickly getting soaked, cold and likely in pain and quickly going into shock. They just kept driving around him. Did they know that was an injured child? Did they think he was an animal or something else? It's hard to say. But they just kept driving around the obstacle. No one even called 911 so that the police could check out the road obstruction. \n\nHe was so close to safety, just a block from home. Finally, though, a motorist did stop and blocked the road before calling 911. Erica Steele, Maurice's mother got home during this time and found that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t home yet. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when she headed back out and found her child injured on the street.\n\nAfter what must have seemed like an interminable amount of time to the little boy, whose clothing was drenched by now, he was rushed to a hospital in St. Louis, where he died just an hour later. \n\nCrimestoppers offered a $5,000 reward. Police have video but say it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide them with enough information. Erica has never stopped fighting for her son.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-motorists-ignore-11-year-old-maurice-richards-killed-in-hit-and-run/\n\nhttp://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/mother-of-boy-killed-in-esl-hit-and-run-urges-driver-to-come-forward/63-75825808\n\nhttp://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/year-after--year-old-dies-in-hit-and-run/article_109b7eaa-b57c-5e42-a9f5-7e7a28c889b9.html\n\nAs a sad postscript, Erica's mother was murdered years before, beaten with a hammer and set on fire. https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/141807604/\n\nMaurice has stuck with me, I guess because this was local for me but also because he was about the same age as my kids. \n\nThe boy in the box is another one that haunts me.

You seem to care about others quite a lot and your friends seem to notice that and because of that tell you to be more selfish.\nMaybe selfish isn't the best word because it has a lot of negative connotation. Maybe you can see it that way that if you take care of yourself and get yourself sorted out then you can be there for others. \n\nThis planning sounds good, maybe (if you dont do that already) you can take some notes or ask if you can record the answers so you can go back though that stuff after the meeting in case you dont get everything because of too many thoughts. Also maybe worth a try to write your thoughts and feelings down before an appointment with your therapist so you can get back to it when asked.\n\nImagine when you look back at this in maybe a year or so (just putting some arbitrary time here) and you then can see how you got through it all or part of it and then you meet someone or read a post from someone in a similar situation needing some assistance. You'd then be able to share your experience and your learnings. \n\nLet us know how the test works out if you like (and if you need to talk more)\n\nAll the best majaviktoria :)\n\n", "annotations": []}

{"id": "293", "text": "I already have an MS, Stanford might not give me another and I just hate the feeling of quitting after I have put so so so much work in. There is like a PhD-lite degree that might be an option, but I really want this fucking doctorate. \n\nAnd yes, it's totally a systemic stress response that I've been trying to work through. I'd love to hear more about specific exercises that have worked for you, if you care to share?<SPLIT_TOKEN>I'm guessing your MS is in AE as well? I would definitely not put myself through more of that if I had to and look into the PhD-lite option. At this point it sounds like it's negatively affecting your mental health and no accolade from any school is worth doing that to yourself. And I'd be happy to share. The first thing I started with is just don't a structured breathing exercises whenever I started to panic or feel stuck. 10 seconds in, hold for 5 seconds, 10 seconds out. Not only will it slow your heart rate and respiration it will actually help slow down the kinetics of the reactions in your brain causing you to feel freaked out. Another thing I have tried is picturing your emotions as a car. The front two wheels are your more base emotions that are difficult to learn to control like panic, anxiety or fear. The rear two are the ones that follow wherever the front two go such as anger, sadness, or calm. By controlling the steering wheel, you can't guide the front two and therefore influence the back two. Does that make sense at all? That one is more of a visualization. Another thing I've tried is to redirect anxiety reactions by teaching myself to recognize them and then redirect them by extrapolating what will happen if what I'm panicking about occurs and how negative are those consequences on a bigger scale. Like what really happens if you only get one grantee degree before you leave school for a while? Will your career end? Probably not. Will you never be accepted to school again? You're smart and have accomplished things other people can't so some school that is a fit will work with you. Things like that. Acknowledge the fear, process it, address it, and work through those negatives to redirect yourself into other possibilities. It helps to keep you from locking in on certain objectives and thinking they HAVE to be met. The only thing you HAVE to do from one minute to the next, is breath. Everything that is a choice.

{"id": "302", "text": "How my ex did it.\n\nShe broke up with me on a Saturday. On the Thursday before she was sending me cutesy collage pictures of the two of us, and saying how much she loved me.\n\nFriday comes around, she'd gone back home to see her parents, and I'd had a really vivid nightmare where we'd broken up so I texted her just explaining the situation and asking if things were alright. She replied that things weren't alright, and that she was going to break up with me when she got back to Uni.\n\nSaturday comes and she's in my dorm, we're talking things out. She says she doesn't feel like I love her anymore, and that the relationship is too much stress.\n\nI dispute the fact that I don't love her, I've been under a lot of stress dealing with the loss of my father, suddenly being the man of the house, as well as her frequent suicide attempts which keep edging nearer and nearer to actually killing her. I was just running out of fuel with it all. We agree on some changes to make to the relationship and snuggle down to watch our favorite program together.\n\nSunday morning she comes into my room to tell me that last night was a mistake and that she was leaving. I'm absolutely heartbroken. The only thing I can say through my tears is \"Will you let me still look after you?\". \n\nThings for the next few days are odd. We're not together, but still touchy feely as hell. We were still on really friendly terms.\n\nIt was her birthday a few days later. I'd saved up my wage to buy her a necklace I thought she'd like. She didn't like it, fair dues, I got it wrong. She ended up throwing it down a corridor at me, telling me to stay out of her room and stay out of her life. I went back to my room to cry, but I ended up getting quite angry. If she wanted me out of her life then fine. That was it, she was doing this shit on her own. I'd damn near burnt myself out for her.\n\nThe next day was my birthday. I wasn't expecting shit from anyone. I came out of my room to find a birthday cake, and some presents. I asked my flatmates who they were from and they all said they'd seen my ex do it. I was so confused. I didn't trust her to not have fucked with something so just threw the cake away, didn't keep any of the presents either. I was pissed off that she was trying to mess around with me like this.\n\nWe had another couple of weeks of awkward tension in the flat, mixed with periods of calm. She eventually moved out leaving an air of never wanting to talk to me again. \n\nA month or two later I was stood by an ambluance with a friend of mine who had experienced serious anaphylaxis. My Ex still lived in the same complex as me, though we rarely saw each other. She ended up walking past while I was out there, came over and started talking to me. I'm already worried about my friend so I didn't really need the anxiety that came with talking to my ex.\n\nAfter the ambulance we went back to not speaking. Until one of my flatmates (a mutual friend of ours) tells me she wants to talk to me. Turns out she did. We agreed to meet up, she suggested going to the bar we went to on our first date. I was a bit sketched out by this but I still cared about her so I wanted to see what she wanted.\n\nShe ends up telling me that she's leaving uni because her mental health is that bad, and that she's attempted suicide another 3 or 4 times in the 6-8 weeks we've been apart.\n\nWe hung out for a bit, and ended up back at mine. We were all touchy feely again, way beyond the point any friends should be. We ended up kissing, and she said she regretted breaking up with me. None of which I initiated, she initiated it all. I'm thinking \"great we're back on!\", nope.\n\nI ended up getting upset because my head was a complete mess with this girl. She left under a bit of a cloud. I at least wanted to clear the air between us, so asked the next morning if we could just talk calmly. She says she doesn't want to be friends anymore. But then she does, but then she doesn't. Eventually we decide to take a break from each other, but that we'll start talking again in a few months. I say, \"Well I'll speak to you in September then, take care of yourself\". Her reply? \"Don't get your hopes up about it.\"\n\nAt that point I'd had it. Fuck her, fuck the energy she took from me, and fuck the fact I still care about her. No one messes me around, gaslights me, and then takes the moral high ground. No one puts baby in a corner.<SPLIT_TOKEN>Damn, you were put through a lot of shit.

The three days she hadn't been in contact with me was because she had been in _jail_.  They had told her she could call people... she'd been able to call her cousin, but because she didn't know my phone number, she couldn't call me.  After three days they sent her back to Thailand, and she was barred from returning to Korea for 5 years.  \n\nSuper shitty situation.  Like, we didn't break up or anything, we were literally ripped apart.  But, I'm glad about it now... not glad that it happened, but I think i may have dodged a bullet.  We are still friends on facebook, and she has had so many surgeries since she returned to Thailand that she is barely recognizable as my ex. But she seems happy enough.  She's met someone new and they are living together and have opened their own club so, it worked out. But I still get a pang when I think about her.

{"id": "426", "text": "The only job I could get right now wouldn't pay enough for daycare..it would probably just pay for daycare only. I also wouldn't have enough to start daycare before I got paid for that hypothetical job..and I would lose our health insurance and probably not be able to get any through work (private practice doctors usually don't insure). Besides all that she doesn't sleep very well and neither do I from pain issues so I'm so exhausted that I couldn't safely work..\n\n\nApparently my husband has seen this post and he gave me his schedule and a paper with what he pays in bills but I feel like he doesn't quite get that I'm more upset that he tries to squish our daughter into what he wants to do or thinks is okay to do (in regards to spending time together) rather than realizing its not about him, its about her and creating a better relationship with her than either of us grew up with, even if some things were good with his family there are tons of things that from what he told me are big wtf to me, and most of all my childhood was awful so I'm big on the belief that you have to improve upon things when you raise your kids rather than repeat what your parents did..theres always something to make better and I think hes just treating this like he can wait around until shes older and expect there to be this big time together change but shes already avoiding him and I'm just clocking out of this relationship because all my energy is going to pushing through some heavy depression just to make sure my.kiddo is happy and stimulated. \n\n\nSorry for all that just have almost no one to talk to about this and its one of the top things I run through in my.head constantly.<SPLIT_TOKEN>That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really rough situation regarding your work options, and unfortunately it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the first time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard it be like that. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something pretty wrong in our society when you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even afford to work and have a kid.  Anyway, something to keep in mind if your ability to work changes is at Home daycare. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more hit or miss, and you have to really check into the providers, but it is so much cheaper. Standard daycare in our town is about &amp;1200 a month. Our daycare provider (who is amazing) charges us $500 a month. The loss of insurance would be a real problem too, though I wonder if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d qualify for some government help. Also, whether you are together or not with your husband, he should be responsible for at least a portion of your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenses - including childcare (child support in our state is 27% of the income). Daycare is a part of our family budget, and we all pay in our share. We had to cut out other stuff to make that work when we decided to have a kid. The fact that you feel the burden of her expenses right now, while not really working, makes little sense. \n\nAnyway, I think counseling for the issues you see surrounding parenting sounds very wise. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really understand the specific concerns you have with the way he parents, but giving the benefit of the doubt, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say that if you are your daughters primary care giver, that could explain why she avoids him at this point. My daughter is most likely to want her dad because he works from home and wakes with her every morning, takes her to daycare, and picks her up. Because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the biggest part of her routine, she tends to show preference a lot of times. Sometimes I have to work to not get hurt feelings, and then I usually just work to get more special time with her... fixing the issue. Possibly, he is getting hurt feelings about not being preferred and just leaving it to you in a sort of \u00e2\u0080\u0098what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mentality? The times you are making dinner and such are perfect bonding opportunities - to break the existing habits he could take her out of the house during this time. They could play outside, find a park, go for a walk, browse the grocery store, have a play date, etc. (all these are free, btw). Doing this allows him to be the hero of the moment for your daughter, and removes you as a default option (it drives me nuts when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to play with my daughter in the evening and all she wants is to cling to daddy - when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not present, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a problem.  Even one single hour an evening would go a long way for everyone, and your husband can still have \u00e2\u0080\u0098me time\u00e2\u0080\u0099 after bedtime. Allowing for this does require trust on your part.  Also, I recommend doing bedtime routine together or taking turns. This has been really positive for us. All of this though, is stuff you will essentially have to sit down and negotiate with your husband, agree upon, and follow through with. It can be done without a counselor, but you guys may benefit from the middle man.", "annotations": []}

A woman with a dog who got on the train later let me cuddle the dog to feel better, a woman working the food car saw how upset i was and moved me up to first class for free and a taxi driver drove me all the way to the hospital for free as well. Obviously i was (and still am) very upset, but it made me feel good knowing that even though my mum wouldn't be around to look after me anymore, there would still be kind strangers who care enough to ask 'are you ok?'.<SPLIT_TOKEN>I am really sorry that you didn't get to say your goodbyes, but I am glad that you live in an area where there are so many lovely people that help people out.", "annotations": []}

Everyone else in my family seemed to move on so quickly that I feel weird that I'm still so upset over it.  \n\nAlso, I haven't listened to any music by Shinee since I heard the news.  Yesterday, I was watching people's Top Kpop Songs of 2017 videos and I had to fast forward when anything by Taemin came on.  The minute I hear one of their songs everything comes crashing back and I get upset all over again.  It really makes me sad because Shinee, Jonghyun, and Taemin made some of my favorite music, and I feel like it should be something that comforts me.<SPLIT_TOKEN>I am so sorry about your cat.", "annotations": []}
